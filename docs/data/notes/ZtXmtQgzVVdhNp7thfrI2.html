<li>Gypsum
<ul>
<li>Used as one of the raw components of cement and its called calcium sulphate.</li>
<li>It is really soft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calcite
<ul>
<li>Chief component of limestone and marble.</li>
<li>It is called Calcium Carbonate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quartz
<ul>
<li>It is very hard.</li>
<li>Used in sandstone and granite</li>
<li>Hence, these materials are also hard.</li>
<li>It is called silicon dioxide.</li>
<li>Harder than Gypsum and Calcite as evident from the above figure.</li>
<li>Artifacts of sandstone have different colors like shown in below image.

<li>This means that if <strong>iron content</strong> is more, then it <strong>gives red</strong> color and if <strong>clay content</strong> is more, then it <strong>gives yellow</strong> color.</li>
<li>The red color of the red fort is red because of ferruginous sandstone. This iron gets rusted and gives red color.</li>
<li>The yellow colored sandstone is called as argilesious sandstone.</li>

<li>
<p>Humanyun's Tomb, Delhi</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-09-03.png"></li>
<li>Made using sandstone (red colored) and marble (white colored).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taj Mahal, Agra</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-10-02.png"></li>
<li>Again made using sandstone (main platform) and brick and marble (outer/external padding).</li>
<li>Iron slabs/rod are used to padd marble and hence we can see some rusting where iron is inserted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Note: Sandstone is always at base and marble is at top. Marble is a porous stone.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is it not the reverse?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because, sandstone is a stronger than marble and hence has the capacity to hold the weight of marble.</li>
</ul>

<p>Biwi ka maqbara, Aurangabad</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-16-57.png"></li>
<li>Made using a very fine and polished limestone and only 25% marble is used.</li>

<ul>
<li>Average temperature of venus is 470 degrees.</li>
<li>Mars surface temperature is -53 degrees.</li>
<li>Earth's surface temperature earlier was 290 degrees and nowadays it is 15 degrees.
<blockquote>
<p>What was the climatic condition that led it to cool down?</p>
<ul>
<li>It was covered with Carbon Dioxide, but during formation of limestone, more than 80% of the gas was consumed and thus, the earth's surface temperature cooled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>During the production of cement, we are reversing the formation of limestone.</li>
<li>Thus, we are releasing a lot of carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>Stones used in formation of qutub minar are marble, sandstone and <strong>quartzite.</strong></li>
<li>Based on quartizite, Alai Minar in Delhi was made. Originally, it was supposed to be a replica of Qutub Minar with double height, but could not be completed.</li>
<li>Kailashnath Temple, Ellora is made using Basalt which is extrunious igneous rock formed by volcanic rocks.</li>
<li>Brihadishwar Temple, Tanjavur is made using granite.</li>
<li><strong>Anything that has to migrate from one surface to other surface, the other surface must be more porous compared to the first one.</strong></li>

<li>Most of the metals are subject to corrosion due to atmospheric moisture.</li>

<li>These metals are placed in the order of their corrsion resistance and hardness.</li>
<li><strong>There is a mistake in the photo. Zinc is more corrosive than iron. Hence swap these two.</strong></li>

<li>First coin was prepared from electrum. It is also called green gold if available naturally, but artificially made electrum is called white gold because some amount of palladium.</li>
<li>Brass will corrode first as compared to bronze because it has amounts of zinc.</li>
<li>Broze is made from 90% copper and 10% tin. Similar is the case for brass but with its respective metals.</li>
<li>Pewter will appear like silver, but that silvery finish is mainly due to tin and little bit of silver.</li>

<ul>
<li>Iron is more abundant than copper in earth's crust.</li>
<li>But still copper age was before iron.</li>
<li>This is because, melting point of iron is much more than that of copper and hence, it was difficult to make iron objects.</li>
<li>Gold only dissolves in aqua regia only.</li>
<li>Some metal occur in natural form and other in ore form.</li>
<li>Stable state of any metal is its rust form and the most active when it is extracted from ore.</li>
<li>This active state is achieved by supplying energy to extract it from its ore.</li>
