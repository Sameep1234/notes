<ul>
<li>All the attributes discussed above are part of this block.</li>

<ul>
<li>To manage multiple processes on a single resources then scheduling comes to the picture.</li>
<li>Thus, you allocate certain span of time to each process and once it gets finished, immediately another process starts.</li>
<li>It gives an appearance that every process runs at the same time because the total time taken by all the process combined is really small.</li>
<li><strong>Trace - List of instructions that are executed by a process.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dispatcher - Program that switches the processor from one process to another.</strong> It is a type of short term scheduler.</li>

<ul>
<li>Suppose that there are some processes which have a lot of instructions to execute. This might take time which is greater than the allocated one.</li>
<li>So in the middle of the execution of a process, dispatcher stops the execution and decides which process should go next.</li>
<li>Once decided, either execution of new process starts or execution of old process continues.</li>
<li>Then, suppose there is an I/O request. Since this is a slow operation, the dispatcher will allow another process to run on the processor.</li>
<li>This goes on and on untill all the processes are executed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The above method is from <strong>processor POV</strong> and is called <strong>interleaving of processes</strong> and the OS manages this through <strong>dispatcher</strong>. From <strong>process POV</strong>, the process gets executed sequencially.</p>

<ul>
<li>Two states
<ul>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Not running</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transition from <strong>not running</strong> to <strong>running</strong> state is called <strong>dispatch</strong> and is called <strong>pause</strong> for the opposite scenario.</li>
<li>There can be at most only one process in running state at a given instance of time.</li>
<li>There are 'n' number of processes in the non-running state.</li>
<li>Thus, to manage all these processes, we need <strong>queue</strong> as the data structure.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Conditions when the process which is running will pause and enter in the queue:
<ul>
<li>Time slot alloted to the process is over.</li>
<li>Made some I/O request which may take time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, dispatcher needs to identify which processes are ready to be executed and then dispatch it from the middle of the queue.</li>
<li>This process is time consuming and complex.</li>
<li>To resolve this, OS must maintain multiple queues. Since there are two types of processes, one who did not terminate but their allocated time got over and others who are waiting for I/O or other resouces.</li>
<li>This, in turn is the 5-state process model.</li>
<li>Total states in this model
<ul>
<li>New - Process that has just been created but not admitted to the pool of the ready state processes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Not loaded in main memory but is created.</strong></li>
<li>This means that PCB for that process has been created but its corresponding data and program has not been loaded/created in the main memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ready</li>
<li>Blocked/Waiting</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Exit (Earlier it was not a state but now it is) - Process which has been released from the pool of processes.
<ul>
<li>However, there is some part of PCB left in main memory for accounting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Ready and Blocked process can enter directly to exit state when its parent process has terminated or the process is terminated by the OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When process spawning occurs, then child process is created in the new state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hang state is equivalent to blocked/waiting state.</p>

<ul>
<li>Suppose there are 10 processes which are in blocked queue waiting for HDD to get accesible and there are 90 processes that are in hang mode.</li>
<li>Now once HDD is ready to be accessed, OS will have to search this blocked queue and move all these processes to ready state.</li>
<li>This is again time consuming and complex. Hence multiple blocked queue model emerged.</li>
