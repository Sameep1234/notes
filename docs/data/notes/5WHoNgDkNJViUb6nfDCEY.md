## Directions and Planes

## Points to ponder (**Lecture 3**)

- Each corner atom in a unit cell contribute 1/8 in cubes and 1/6 in hex.
- Body center atom contribute 1 and face atoms contribute 1/2.
- For hcp number of atoms in the unit cell is 6. (3 BC (contribute 1), 2 FC (contribute 1/2), 12 Corner (contribute 1/6))

## Density Computation

- $\\rho$ = $\\frac{nA}{VcNa}$
- Here $\\rho$ is the density, n is the number of atoms in a unit cell, A is the atomic mass of the element, Vc is the volume of unit cell and Na is the avogadro's number.
- **Note that this density is theoretical and not measured. There is some discrepancy between the two.**

## Crystal Directions

> Always divide by the biggest number. Eg. 4th case in the above image.

## Extra points

- To represent direction, use square brackets.
- To represent plane, use round brackets.
- Parallel planes belong to the same **family** of planes.
- To represent family of planes, use curly brackets.
- To represent family of directions, use angular brackets.
- There should not be comma between numbers in either of the cases.
- Negative coordinates are also possible and are represented by a bar over the number.
- For hcp, the coordinate system is different and contains one more extra coordinate in the xy plane.
- We calculate it using the below formula.

- Lattice parameters include the three edge lengths (a, b, c) and the three interaxial angles ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$).

## Miller Indices

- This is one of the information required to study X-Ray defractogram
- Procedure to find these indices
  - Note the intercepts made by plane in terms of **lattice constants** a,b and c.
  - Note the coefficient of the intercepts.
  - Find inverse of them.
  - Find LCM and multiply them by LCM.
  - These points that you get are the Miller indices.

## How to draw planes?

- First get the miller indices.
- **Be careful about what is given, if intercepts are given the  calculate miller indices otherwise directly use miller indices provided.**
- Simply select an origin and the plane must pass through the miller indices.
- Make sure to treat miller indices as simple coordinates.

## Linear and Planar Density

- This is **atomic** density.
- FCC Structure
  - Case 1 (100)
    - Linear Density = $\\frac{number of atoms}{length of the vector}$ = $\\frac{1}{a}$
    - Planar Density = $\\frac{number of atoms}{area of the plane}$ = $\\frac{2}{a^2}$
  - Case 2 (110)
    - Linear Density = $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}a}$
    - Planar Desity = $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}a^2}$
  - Case 3 (111)
    - Linear Density = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}a}$

## Points to Ponder

- For the area for calculation of planar density, follow these steps
  - Imagine the plane and the crystal lattice.
  - Use [this site](http://calistry.org/calculate/latticePlanesMillerIndices) for better visualization.
  - The corner atoms will contribute 1/4 to the area, the face atoms will contribute 1/2 to the area and the body centered atoms will contribute 1 to the area.
