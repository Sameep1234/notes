## McClelland's theory of needs
* It states that achievement, power, and affiliation are three important needs that help explain motivation.

* Individuals who have high need for acheivement will perform best when the percieve that the chances of success are 50%.
* If less, they consider it gambling and if more they consider it to be no challenge to their skills.
* Relation with job performance

    * Low affiliation means they will work more professionally and not attach themselves with their employees.
    * High power --> Obvious reasons.

## Reinforcement Theory
* A theory suggesting that behaviour is a function of its consequences.
* Operant conditioning and its extention (Social Learning theory).

## SDT (Self-Determination theory)
* Eg. Volunteringly working for blind people association and then it hiring her.

* Relatedness is similar to affiliation.
* Competence is similar to acheivement.
* Autonomy is dissimilar to power because autonomy is internal (I want to do) where power (others are making me do) is external.
* **Cognitive evaluation theory**
    * Cricket example Rahul's monetary incentives were reduced and he did not want to play cricket even though loved it.

    * Don't associate external rewards to any task which is intrinsically rewarding to an individual.
* Self-concordance
    * Degree to which people's reason for pursuing goals are consistent with their interests and core values.

## Goal-Setting Theory
* A theory stating that specific and difficult goals with feedback lead to higher performance.
* Components
    * Specificity
        * How much should be done in how much time? **Acts as internal stimulus.**
    * Acceptance
        * If goals are accepted, then difficult the goal, higher the level of performance.
    * Feedback
        * How well one is progressing toward the goal.
        * Helps reduce any deviation/discrepancy.
        * Externally or internally generated.
* Goal commitment
    * They believe that they can achieve the goal.
    * They want to achieve the goal.
    * Relationship is strong when attaining goal will have some **attractive outcome**.
* Task characteristic
    * Complexity
        * Low implies better relationship with outcome.
    * Independent vs interdependent
* National Culture
    * Collectivistic countries
        * Achievable moderate goals can be more motivating.
    * High power distance
        * Assigned goals can have higher goal commitment.
