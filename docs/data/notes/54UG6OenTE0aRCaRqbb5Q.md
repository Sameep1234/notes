> How to classify an oil as drying or non-drying oil?

> Check for iodine number. Iodine number greater implies it is drying oil. Iodine number shows mow many glycides are unsaturated. Thus, more unsaturated, more drying and vice versa.

## Acrylic Painting

- It dries very quickly.
- It dired to touch in 2 hours and complete drying happens in 1-2 days.
- It dries by evaporation of water.
- It contains a synthetic rasin called acrylic rasin and vehicle is water.
- Acrylic rasin is very similar to oil and hence it does not easily mix with water.
- Thus, we add emulsifier to bind oil and water.
- Further, we add surfactants. It has polar (head) and non polar (tail) ends.
- The water is binded to head and oil to tail and a suspension is created.
- But the paint formed is can not be used to paint because the microorganisms can grow in the suspension.
- Thus, we add deformer which is a dispersing agent preventing the microorganisms to grow.

## Fresco Painting

- It is majorly used in wall paintings.
- Types
  - Fresco Buono
    - Freshly applied
    - Binder/adhesive is not added.
    - But to bind, they prepare a lime plaster everyday and dry powders are applied to it when it is wet.
    - **Pigment is applied when the wall (lime plastered) is wet.**
    - **One day's work/job reference here.**
  - Fresco Secco
    - Dried
    - **Pigment is applied on dry plaster.**
    - Pigment is mixed in lime water and applied on dry plaster.

## Extra Points

- Function of binder is two folded.
- It binds the pigment powders together.
- It makes the paint adhere onto the painted surface.
- Function of vehicle is to give the binder flow which in turn provides the flow to the binder.
- The oil in oil painting has to be such that it can dry and binds the paint.
- Musturd oil, olive oil and groundnut oil are  one such oil that **can't be used.**
- Drying oil includes linseed oil, poppyseed oil and walnut oil.
- Drying of oil does not mean evaporation, it means that the oil is oxidized and cross linked.
- Oxidation makes the oil dry and cross linking makes the oil hard.
- Cross linking simply means that the molecules of oil get tangled into one another.
