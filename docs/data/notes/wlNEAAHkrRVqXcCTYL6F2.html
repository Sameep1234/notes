<ul>
<li>When there is a problem, we make a decision and to the method is to choose one of the alternatives that we have in front of us.</li>
<li>Problem can be considered as discrepancy exists between current state of affairs and desired state.</li>
<li>In simpler terms, it is the difference between what we have and what we want.</li>

<ul>
<li>A process of making decisions by constructing <strong>simplified models</strong> that extract the <strong>essential features</strong> from problem without capturing all their complexity.</li>
<li>It includes choosing of that option which is satisfactory and sufficient to one's needs.</li>
<li>How is this done?
<ul>
<li>Alternatives that are highly visible.</li>
<li>Reviewing alternatives focusing on choice that differ from current state.</li>
<li>Until we find good enough option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Note that in bounded rationality we do not focus on value maximisation but choose that option which is "good enough" for our use case.</strong></li>
<li>To search quickly, majority of the "e-commerce" sites have filters, customer reviews etc.</li>

<h2 id="intuition"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#intuition"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Intuition</h2>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>unconscious</strong> process created out of <strong>distilled experience</strong>.</li>
<li>Unconscious process means that we don't know that we are actually thinking about that decision.</li>
<li>Unconcious proceeses are usually fast, relies on thinking information from different sources and engages with emotion.</li>
<li>Expert based intuition decision can be very accurate and thus it can help in effective decision making.</li>
