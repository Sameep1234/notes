<li>Chromium oxide layer is impervious layer. This means that chromium layer is non-porous.</li>
<li>If there is a small scratch in steel objects, then the chromium oxide layer is ripped off and the inner (iron) metal is exposed.</li>
<li>This is the place where you may see corrosion in steel objects.</li>

<li>Made using zinc, copper and silver.</li>
<li>Zinc and silver provide silvery appearance and copper provides a bit of yellow appearance.</li>
<li>This black layer appears because of alloy of zinc and copper. Silver is very low in quantity.</li>
<li>First zinc and copper is melted and then the object is dipped in copper sulphate solution to obtain a blackish color.</li>
<li>This black is temporary.</li>
<li>Now, with metallic stylus, designs are engraved. It is a very sharp metallic point/tool.</li>
<li>Then, they take silver wire and hammer it in those grooves and thus this silver design is made. This is called silver inlay.</li>
<li>Now, to smoothen the surface, it is polished. With regorous polishing, all the temporary black goes away and the entire silvery surface turns white.</li>
<li>In final preparation, <strong>mud of bidar</strong> + water + dilute ammonium chloride and a dough is made and then you rub this object.</li>
<li>By doing this, all the zinc area becomes permanent black.</li>
<li>Silver does not become black because silver is less reactive then zinc and hence does not get converted to black color.</li>
<li><strong>Silver only reacts with sulphide. This is chloride.</strong></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Made of clay. It is neither metallic nor organic. Clay is the final product of weathering of rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Clay is basically silica and alumina. (SiO2 and Al2O3).</li>
<li>When you introduce water, clay becomes really soft and it disintegrates easily.</li>
<li>To overcome this problem, we heat the clay at very high temperature and as a result, it becomes very hard and dense.</li>
<li>So basically, on heating we are removing water and hence it looses its plasticity.</li>
<li>Terracotta army
<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-02-41.png"></li>
<li>Terra means earth</li>
<li>Terracota is basically fired clay.</li>
<li>Brick is made of terracota.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BASIC Materials</li>
<li>Stucco is made from unbaked clay or sunbaked clay. It is not fired but is sunbaked and hence becomes crucial to study.</li>
<li>It is majorly found in Gandhara, Afghanistan.</li>

<li>Terracota comes under erathenware. It gets red color due to inclusion of iron.</li>
<li>Bone china is a type of porcelain and fired at 1350 degrees and is mostly white in color.</li>
<li>White colored clay called kaolin is used to make bone china.</li>

<ul>
<li>When you keep on heating/firing any material, the ultimate color it will emit will always be white.</li>
<li>This happens because of the stages of heating. In the first stage, the carbon layer is burnt and is black in color.</li>
<li>Now on further increasing the temperature, you will see orange color and then becomes red and then it becomes ash colored (grey) and finally becomes white.</li>
</ul>
