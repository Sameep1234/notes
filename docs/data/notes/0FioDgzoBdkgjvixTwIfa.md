## Electrochemical series and more on metals

- It is the disordered state that is stable state and ordered state is the active one.
- This is because, you put some energy in the disordered state to make it in order.
- Every metal, from the moment extraction is done, it wants to go to its ore form.
- When a metal is corroded, rust hinders the property of metal. Thus, we can say that the non-metallic quality of metal increases.
- **Magnetic effect** is used to detect how much **core metal** is left and how much **rust** is formed.

## Electrochemical Series

- The metals here are placed according to their decreasing reactivity. Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.
- Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.
- It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.
- Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations. Another reason for that use is that it is an excellent conductor of electrivity.

- Oxidation 
  - When a metal looses electron. 
  - The power to loose electron is called oxidation potential.
  - Lesser reactive metals have lower oxidation potential than more reactive metals.
- Reduction
  - When a metal gains electron.
  - The power to gain electron is called reduction potential.
  - Lesser reactive metals have higher reduction potential than more reactive metals.
- Reducing agent is a more reactive metal that displaces a metal from its sulfate state and vice versa.
- In metallic terms, oxidation is also called corrosion.

## Galvanic Cell

- Also known as Voltaic cell or Daniel cell or Electrochemical cell

- Electrode is a solid electrical conductor that carries a current. Two types include anode and cathode.
- Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.
- Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.
- Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.
- This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.
- So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.
- **To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.**
- Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.
- Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection. (Used mainly for protecting silver by coating gold on it).

## Tarnising of silver

- Silver is almost a noble metal and hence it is very difficult for it to corrode.

- Color is black.
- Oxygen can not harm silver but sulfur can.
- Only on the surface.
- We preserve tarnished silver to preserve silver and it also represent age and authenticity in silver artifacts.
- Patina is just a layer and surface discoloration. It is a surface phenomena.
- Silver sulfide layer is called as noble patina because it is non reactive.
- Oxide layer on broze is blackish in color or called as blackish patina.
- Cuprous oxide layer is brownish in color and later it will change to cupric oxide which is more stable and is blackish in color.

## Types of oxide

- Unstable metal oxide - Gold, Silver and Platinum
- Stable metal oxide - Copper, Tin and Lead
- Volatile metal oxide - Molebdenum
- Porous metal oxide - Sodium, Potassium, Manganese and iron.
