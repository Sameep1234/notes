- Basically, whenever an electron tranverse from lower energy state to higher, it requires energy.
- Whenever it traverse from higher energy state to lower, it emits energy in the form of light.
- This is basic principle of LEDs.
- We use semiconductors for it. It has some bandgaps which emit light of particular frequency and as a result emit light of particular color.
- Connections
