## Introduction to Material Science and Engineering

## Points to Ponder

- With slight change in physical properties, we can get a whole new material. These are **amorphous** and **crystalline**.
- Difference between LED and solar cell is that one emits the light and other absorbs the light.

## Assessment and Evaluation

- Mid Sem Exam - 25%
- End Sem Exam - 30%
- Lab Work (including viva (15%) and theory exam (10%)) - 25%
- Project - 10% (Based on ppt presentation and viva)
- Tests/Quizes - 10% (Two Quiz of 5% each)

## Project Details

- Submit a report
- Viva will be conducted

## Course Material

- Textbook - Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction, William D Callister 6th Edition, John Wiley & Sons.
