<ul>
<li>It is the disordered state that is stable state and ordered state is the active one.</li>
<li>This is because, you put some energy in the disordered state to make it in order.</li>
<li>Every metal, from the moment extraction is done, it wants to go to its ore form.</li>
<li>When a metal is corroded, rust hinders the property of metal. Thus, we can say that the non-metallic quality of metal increases.</li>
<li><strong>Magnetic effect</strong> is used to detect how much <strong>core metal</strong> is left and how much <strong>rust</strong> is formed.</li>
</ul>

<li>The metals here are placed according to their decreasing reactivity. Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.</li>
<li>Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.</li>
<li>It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.</li>
<li>Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations. Another reason for that use is that it is an excellent conductor of electrivity.</li>

<li>Oxidation 
<ul>
<li>When a metal looses electron. </li>
<li>The power to loose electron is called oxidation potential.</li>
<li>Lesser reactive metals have lower oxidation potential than more reactive metals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduction
<ul>
<li>When a metal gains electron.</li>
<li>The power to gain electron is called reduction potential.</li>
<li>Lesser reactive metals have higher reduction potential than more reactive metals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reducing agent is a more reactive metal that displaces a metal from its sulfate state and vice versa.</li>
<li>In metallic terms, oxidation is also called corrosion.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Also known as Voltaic cell or Daniel cell or Electrochemical cell</li>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-39-33.png"></li>
<li>Electrode is a solid electrical conductor that carries a current. Two types include anode and cathode.</li>
<li>Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.</li>
<li>Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.</li>
<li>Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.</li>
<li>This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.</li>
<li>So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.</li>
<li><strong>To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.</strong></li>
<li>Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.</li>
<li>Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection. (Used mainly for protecting silver by coating gold on it).</li>

<ul>
<li>Silver is almost a noble metal and hence it is very difficult for it to corrode.</li>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-53-23.png"></li>
<li>Color is black.</li>
<li>Oxygen can not harm silver but sulfur can.</li>
<li>Only on the surface.</li>
<li>We preserve tarnished silver to preserve silver and it also represent age and authenticity in silver artifacts.</li>
<li>Patina is just a layer and surface discoloration. It is a surface phenomena.</li>
<li>Silver sulfide layer is called as noble patina because it is non reactive.</li>
<li>Oxide layer on broze is blackish in color or called as blackish patina.</li>
<li>Cuprous oxide layer is brownish in color and later it will change to cupric oxide which is more stable and is blackish in color.</li>

<ul>
<li>Unstable metal oxide - Gold, Silver and Platinum</li>
<li>Stable metal oxide - Copper, Tin and Lead</li>
<li>Volatile metal oxide - Molebdenum</li>
<li>Porous metal oxide - Sodium, Potassium, Manganese and iron.</li>
