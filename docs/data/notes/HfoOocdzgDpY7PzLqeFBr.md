## System Calls and Architecture of UNIX

## Intro to system calls

- System calls are the most important and crucial concept in OS. It is basically a link connecting user to the OS.
- Formally, it is a **programming interface (like waiter connecting customers to kitchen in a restaurant)** to use the services provided by the OS. They are the programs that help give access to the functionalities provided by the OS.
- They are written in a high-level language like C or C++.
- POSIX API is used for Linux and Win32 API is used for windows.

## Implementation of System Call

- Associated with each function call. Eg. If you call a function printf() in C, then it internally calls an associated system call telling the OS to display the written part on the scree.
- Every OS have a list of system call along with ID's.
- System call interface maintains a table with ID's as indices.
- This interface invokes a particular system call in OS kernel and returns the status and return-values if any.
- Details are hidden from programmer by the API.

## Relationship between API, System Call and OS

## Types of system calls

- File Management - Eg. create, open, close etc.
- Device Management - request, release, read, write etc.
- Protection - control access, get and set permissions etc.
- Information maintenance - get time, set process etc.
- Communications - create, delete communication, send or recieve messages etc.

### Architecture of UNIX

- UNIX is an OS just like Linux.

- In fact linux is based on UNIX but is more complicated than UNIX.

- UNIX system follows monolithic approach

- UNIX System Kernel

- **In Linux or UNIX, everything is in terms of files. Thus, it becomes crucial to understand file system.**
