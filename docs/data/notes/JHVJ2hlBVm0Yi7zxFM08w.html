<ul>
<li>Any layer that is formed on the metal surface is called patina.</li>
<li>Layers
<ul>
<li>Oxide</li>
<li>Carbonate</li>
<li>Sulphate</li>
<li>Acetate</li>
<li>Chloride</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those patina which is protective in nature is called noble patina and those that are corrosive in nature are called malignant patina.</li>
<li>Cuprous oxide (Brown) and cupric oxide (Black) is noble patina as they do not react and protect copper metal.</li>
<li>Greenish layer deposited on copper is carbonate layer.
<ul>
<li>It is also known as malachite.</li>
<li><strong>Noble patina</strong> but in very rare cases it is malignant patina.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Malignant Patina (Bronze Disease)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bronze metals form chloride layer (atacamite and nantokite).</li>

<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-23-50-53.png"></li>
<li>Two forms of carbonate layer.</li>
<li>Carbonate ions are formed when carbon dioxide is dissoved in water.</li>
<li>We may also get carbonic acid in a similar fashion.</li>
<li>On scratching a corroded metal, we get pure metal inside it. Now that in turn acts as anode and the corroded layer acts as cathode.</li>
<li>Then follow the above figure.</li>
<li>Oxidation number is the charge an element has in a compound/molecule.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If in the environment, if you have a lot of CO2, then what will you get? (Azurite or Malachite)</p>
<ul>
<li>We will get azurite as in more CO2 concentrated areas, it is a stable carbonate layer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Nature of Fe2O3 is unstable (doubtfull) and porous</li>
<li>This is malignant patina.</li>
<li>Because of its porosity, the inner core of the metal is always exposed and hence is called malignant patina.</li>
<li><strong>Startling fact</strong>
<ul>
<li>Qutub Minar is made of iron.</li>
<li>Built about 1500-1600 years back.</li>
<li>But still, there is no rusting.</li>
<li><strong>In iron, a little bit of phosphorous is mixed and it forms a complex layer by reacting with hydrogen and oxygen.</strong></li>
<li>Hence, the iron pillar does not get corroded.</li>
<li>Now, phosphorous and sulphur have tendency to crack any metal (even iron) if it remains inside that metal.</li>
<li>Hence, when iron is heated to 1500 degrees, phosphorous and sulphur escape and iron is protected.</li>
<li>Then, with continuous hammering, the remaining phosphorous comes out on the surface of the metal and hence forms a protective layer.</li>
<li>To make the pillar, a little bit of zinc was also added in the bottom/base of the pillar.</li>
<li>Zinc acts as a <strong>sacrificial anode.</strong></li>
<li>This means that zinc will corrode and protect iron.</li>
