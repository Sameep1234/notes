<ul>
<li>It's main principle is that children act on their physical environment by playing and exploring to develop schemes.</li>
<li>Schemes are nothing but metal representation of bodily movement of something that a person can do with an object.</li>
<li>Example of scheme include cricket bat and watch.</li>
<li>Schemes develop through <strong>assimilation and accomodation.</strong></li>
<li>Assimination is the process by which new expeciences are incorporated into existing schemes.</li>
<li>Accomodation is the process by which schemes are changed and new experiences are <strong>assimilated.</strong></li>
<li>Example is of a child trying to stack smaller blocks on hollow bigger block.</li>
<li>Another example can be of telephone. After multiple iterations a child knows that when a telephone rings, we pick it up and talk. Similar is the case with wireless mobile phones but the range is low in wired case.</li>
<li>Thus, identifying the scheme is of prime importance. So, for the telephone example, the scheme is that whenever it rings, someone comes and picks it up.</li>
<li>Now, the new experience is of mobile phones. What to do when it rings? This has to be incorported by the child.</li>
<li>Operations
<ul>
<li>Those actions that can be reversed or they are called reversible actions.</li>
<li>Types of operations
<ul>
<li>Cause and effect - Eg. Switch</li>
<li>Conservation of substance - Eg. Clay</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Four stages
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensorimotor stage</strong> (birth to 2 yrs) 
<ul>
<li>Focus on present object and not on the object that is not there.</li>
<li>They have basic schmes of shaking, twisting, pushing etc. (inbuilt)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Preoperational stage</strong> (2 to 7 years)
<ul>
<li>Think about the objects that are not present.</li>
<li>Don't think of reversible consequence of actions.</li>
<li>Use perception rather than logic.</li>
<li>Eg. Water in different shapes of container.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Concrete-Operational stage</strong> (7 to 11 yrs)
<ul>
<li>These are tied to their actual experiences.</li>
<li>Eg. Water in bottle to glass</li>
<li><strong>They are not able to generalise the results to all the types of substances.</strong></li>
<li>They are not able to think in hypothetical situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Formal-Operational stage</strong> (11 to 16 yrs)
<ul>
<li>Notice similarites between operations performed on different objects.</li>
<li><strong>They are able to generalise the results obtained in one situations to other situations.</strong></li>
<li>They can now think in hypothetical world.</li>
<li>Eg. How much air does a room contain? It is the volume of the room.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Its main principle is that children develop in the social world by interacting with other people and products of their cultural history.</li>
<li>Eg. Child born in a tribe and in a modern family.
<ul>
<li>The difference between learning language in modern family and that in tribe would be of written documentation.</li>
<li>Tribe people might not have a written manuscript of the symbols and language that they use whereas modern family have perfectly well maintained documentation of the rules and regulations of their language.</li>
<li>Thus, a child in tribe might learn about only the spoken part and not the written part whearas in modern family, a child learns both.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social elements
<ul>
<li>Symbols</li>
<li>Knowledge</li>
<li>Ideas</li>
<li>Mode of reasoning</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>In the above example, from piaget's perspective, the child discovered the rule of commutativity because the child acted on the pebbles (physical environment) and while playing with it.</li>
<li>From the vigotsky's perspective, the child belongs to the community where they know how to count or at least that community value counting because of which the child started counting.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the child could have done numerous other activities with the pebbles like throwing it, catching it etc.</li>
<li>This also means that the community also has some symbols that facilitate counting. Otherwise, how will a child count?</li>
