## Tree ring analysis
* Dendrochronology
    * Used to estimate age of wooden artifacts.
    * Every year wood grows a ring and by calculating the ring, the age of wood can be guessed.
* Dendroclimatology tells you the environment type of climate. It helps in estimating date as well as the climate.
    * If it is the ring means less precipitation and if it is thick then it indicated flood or very good precipitation.
    * Very thin means drought like situation.
    * Some burn scars means that a particular year had some fire events etc.

## Obsidian Hydration Dating
* Obsidian is an extrusive igneous rock and called as volcanic glass because it does not have porosity.
* It is so dense and hence it is called volcanic glass.
* Only useful to date obsidian based objects (quite obvious).

* Gathers the layer of water on surface when viewed under a microscope.
* Since there is no porosity, the water does not get absorbed. Instead, it gets adsorbed.
* We have no idea when this water/moisture started to get adsorbed. It is possible that it might have started a 1000 years back.
* If there is any scratch or crack on the stone, the fresh surface is exposed.
* This fresh surface will not have any amount of moisture present.
* But after the crack has been formed, moisture starts to accumulate and form hydration rim or rind.
* When taken under a high magnifying microscope, we can measure the thickness of the water rim and as a result calculate the age of the artifact.

## Potassium-Argon Dating

* Used for dating of stone materials especially igneous rocks like granite.
* 'K' has some isotopes present.

* Argon is inert/noble gas and does not take part in any chemical reaction.
* When lava is in molten state, potassium and argon are present.
* As molten lava gets solidified, argon starts escaping as it is an inert material and does not want to get involved in any reactions.
* When the rock has solidified completely, there was no presence of argon.
* This radioactive potassium goes into a beta-decay and form two kind of products.
* When neutron changes to proton, atomic number gets incremented by 1 while mass number remains the same.
* This means calcium is formed and it does not escape.
* Now if proton changes to neutron, the mass number remains same but atomic number decrements by 1.
* This means argon is formed.
* Note that initially argon was not there as it had escaped. But now, argon is present as a result of beta-decay.
* So this argon will tell us the age of igneous rock.
* So if you take the ratio of Argon to original potassium, you can determine the age of the rock.

## Extra Points
* Ways to examin artifacts
    * Under normal light.
    * Under UV light.
        * When exposed under UV light, the old material and new material will florence differently.
        * This means that the older material will be brighter whereas newer material will be darker.
        * Used in finerprinting process.
            * Suppose there is a sculpture in which hand is broken and you have attached a new hand in such a way that no one can know that hand was broken.
            * So it will become very difficult to authenticate this sculpture and hence this process can be used.
        * It is also helpful in identifying coutnerfeit products

    * Under infrared radiation.
        * Also helps in fingerprinting a artifact.
        * Problem here is that it does not lie in visible range.
        * So you have to look at some monitor type device to see the infrared rays.
        * These rays have a property of penetrating although less deeper than radio waves etc.
        * Suppose what is behind/underneath the painting or object, we can see through IR.

            * Text in left is not properly visible whereas in right it is visible.
    * Under X-rays.
    * Instruments
        * Microscopes
            * Scanning electron microscope (SEM).
            * Transmission electron microscope (TEM).
            * Confocal laser microscopes (CLM).
    * FTIR (Fourier Transformation infrared spectroscope)
    * Raman Spectroscopy.
