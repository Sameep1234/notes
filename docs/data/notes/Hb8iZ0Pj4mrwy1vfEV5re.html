<blockquote>
<p>Individuals learn by <strong>observing</strong> what happens to other people and just by being told about something as well as through direct experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In layman terms, social learning theory is that we learn by observing others and in turn gaining <strong>experience</strong>.</li>
<li>Observational learning is the process of watching others for gaining <strong>experience.</strong></li>
<li>Vicarious Reinforcement - Not necessary for an individual to explicitly behave in order to learn, it is enough to observe others for some actions and their consequences.</li>
<li>It is a natural extension of operant conditioning.</li>
<li><strong>It depends on how an individual perceives and defines the consequence.</strong> Eg. Severity of phone confiscation may be different for those who use two phones and those who use only one.</li>
<li><strong>Bobo Doll Experiment is the very good example of social learning.</strong></li>
<li>Processes
<ul>
<li>Attentional Processes - focusing on critical features.</li>
<li>Retention Processes - How well the individual remembers action of model.</li>
<li>Motor reproduction processes - Converting retained thoughts into action.</li>
<li>Reinforcement processes - Motivation to exhibit modeled behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>They act on their physical environment.</li>
<li>They are like little scientists who experiment on physical environment.</li>
<li>Scheme is <strong>what an object does.</strong></li>
