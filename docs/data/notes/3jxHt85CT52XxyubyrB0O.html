<ul>
<li>Fresco Buono - Apply paint when plaster is wet.
<ul>
<li>Adhesive is not added with pigment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fresco Secco - Apply paint when plaster is dry.
<ul>
<li>Pigment is added in lime water (adhesive).</li>
<li>Called as ala-gila technique in Rajasthan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does paint stick on the wall in Fresco Buono even if adhesive is not applied?</p>
<ul>
<li>When you prepare the wet water, you apply lime plaster.</li>
<li>Then you apply pigment directly on the wet lime plaster.</li>
<li>Ca(OH)2 (Wet lime plaster) + CO2 (from atmosphere) --> CaCO3 (limestone is insoluble in water)</li>
<li>Thus, the fomation of stone helps in adhesiveness and stays for very long period.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Degradtion in stone
<ul>
<li>Surface abrasion
<ul>
<li>Any scratch on stone surface.</li>
<li>Happens naturally also. Wind blows --> Carries sand and dirt particles which are pointed (angular which means sharp corner) in shape --> surface abrasion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Erosion
<ul>
<li>Due to hitting (because of wind blowing), sand particles turn round.</li>
<li>Thus, all the carved edges in any stone sculpture will get flattened.</li>
<li>In any stone, lets say sandstone, all particles are bonded together and as a result of surface erosion, the edges get damaged.</li>
<li>Surface erosion can be defined as loosing of details in a sculpture due to continuous hitting of sand and dirt particles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Salt crystallization
<ul>
<li><strong>Very important and huge problem.</strong></li>
<li>Salt comes from soil which is in ground.</li>
<li>Then how does saltt get up like shown in below figure?
<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-12-04-08-25-20.png"></li>
<li>Salts are generally dissolved in liquid (water in this case). This happens because salt ionizes very easily.</li>
<li>Through capillary actions, salt reaches high up on the wall of the structure.</li>
<li>The pores act as capilaries.</li>
<li>More and more moisture on the walls, more and more salt can get accumulated.</li>
<li>Now, when moisture escapes because of heat, salt crystallizes and this leads to expansion of the structure.</li>
<li>Then, when moisture again comes because of humidity, it contracts.</li>
<li>This results into development of huge cracks and gets deteriorated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exfoliation
<ul>
<li>This is a <strong>characteristic feature of sandstone</strong>. (Thus, this damage only occurs in sandstone as it is a layerified structure.)</li>
<li>Sanstone has different layers and these layers are porous.</li>
<li>Thus, salts will flow inside the stones.</li>
<li>In hot climate, evaporation takes place on the exterior/external part of the wall.</li>
<li>Thus, salt will try to accumulate in the exterior part as where there is water, salt will try to go there. Water is flowing from interior to exterior part because of evaporation.</li>
<li>Thus, the salt crystallizes in the exterior region of the wall.</li>
<li>This will create expansion of the exterior layer and it will fall.</li>
<li><strong>Thus, layer by layer, the external surface detaches and this is known as exfoliation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Marble is Calcite/Carcium Carbonate (CaCO3).</li>
<li>This CaCO3 reacts with acid rain and forms calcium sulphate which is soluble.</li>
<li>Thus, it looses all the details and it is said that marble <strong>leaches out.</strong></li>
<li>Acid rain means NO2 and SO2 (both present in atmosphere) dissolves in water and forms HNO3 and H2SO4.</li>

<ul>
<li>Ceramics are very porous in nature (except porcellian).</li>
<li>Porosity depends on heating. More heating, less porous and vice versa.</li>
