<blockquote>
<p>Any <strong>relative permanent</strong> change in <strong>behaviour</strong> that occurs as a result of <strong>experience</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Relatively Permanent - This does not mean that the time frame should be large. It could be short but it has to be relatively larger than the past conversation.</li>
<li>Change in behaviour - Obvious reasons. Observable actions. There could be many types of behaviour including learned and reflexive behaviour.</li>
<li>Experience - When you pay attention or focus on a particular conversation or an event, then that convsersation or event becomes the part of <strong>your experience.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This means that we are involving sensory organs and hence it becomes a part of an experience.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Classical Conditioning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a <strong>learning process</strong> through which we <strong>create new reflexes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unconditioned Stimulus - Something that is already there in the environment.</li>
<li>Unconditioned Response - Reflexive behaviour.</li>
<li>Conditioned Stimulus - Something which is not part of the environment or an event that occurs multiple times.</li>
<li>Conditioned Response - Learned behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operant Conditioning</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Behaviour</strong> is a <strong>function of consequences</strong>. We do something to <strong>get something</strong> or to <strong>avoid something.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the consequences are positive, you repeat that activity and vice versa.</li>
<li>We call it <strong>operant</strong> because we operate on the world. We are not doing it automatically or reflexively. We <strong>consciously think</strong> about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
