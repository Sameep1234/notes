<blockquote>
<p>How to classify an oil as drying or non-drying oil?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Check for iodine number. Iodine number greater implies it is drying oil. Iodine number shows mow many glycides are unsaturated. Thus, more unsaturated, more drying and vice versa.</p>

<li>It dries very quickly.</li>
<li>It dired to touch in 2 hours and complete drying happens in 1-2 days.</li>
<li>It dries by evaporation of water.</li>
<li>It contains a synthetic rasin called acrylic rasin and vehicle is water.</li>
<li>Acrylic rasin is very similar to oil and hence it does not easily mix with water.</li>
<li>Thus, we add emulsifier to bind oil and water.</li>
<li>Further, we add surfactants. It has polar (head) and non polar (tail) ends.</li>
<li>The water is binded to head and oil to tail and a suspension is created.</li>
<li>But the paint formed is can not be used to paint because the microorganisms can grow in the suspension.</li>
<li>Thus, we add deformer which is a dispersing agent preventing the microorganisms to grow.</li>

<li>Binder/adhesive is not added.</li>
<li>But to bind, they prepare a lime plaster everyday and dry powders are applied to it when it is wet.</li>

<ul>
<li>Function of binder is two folded.</li>
<li>It binds the pigment powders together.</li>
<li>It makes the paint adhere onto the painted surface.</li>
<li>Function of vehicle is to give the binder flow which in turn provides the flow to the binder.</li>
<li>The oil in oil painting has to be such that it can dry and binds the paint.</li>
<li>Musturd oil, olive oil and groundnut oil are  one such oil that <strong>can't be used.</strong></li>
<li>Drying oil includes linseed oil, poppyseed oil and walnut oil.</li>
<li>Drying of oil does not mean evaporation, it means that the oil is oxidized and cross linked.</li>
<li>Oxidation makes the oil dry and cross linking makes the oil hard.</li>
<li>Cross linking simply means that the molecules of oil get tangled into one another.</li>
