<ul>
<li>It states that achievement, power, and affiliation are three important needs that help explain motivation.</li>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-11-23-23-27-54.png"></li>
<li>Individuals who have high need for acheivement will perform best when the percieve that the chances of success are 50%.</li>
<li>If less, they consider it gambling and if more they consider it to be no challenge to their skills.</li>
<li>Relation with job performance
<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-11-23-23-31-01.png"></li>
<li>Low affiliation means they will work more professionally and not attach themselves with their employees.</li>
<li>High power --> Obvious reasons.</li>

<ul>
<li>Eg. Volunteringly working for blind people association and then it hiring her.</li>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-11-23-23-37-38.png"></li>
<li>Relatedness is similar to affiliation.</li>
<li>Competence is similar to acheivement.</li>
<li>Autonomy is dissimilar to power because autonomy is internal (I want to do) where power (others are making me do) is external.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive evaluation theory</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cricket example Rahul's monetary incentives were reduced and he did not want to play cricket even though loved it.</li>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-11-23-23-44-18.png"></li>
<li>Don't associate external rewards to any task which is intrinsically rewarding to an individual.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-concordance
<ul>
<li>Degree to which people's reason for pursuing goals are consistent with their interests and core values.</li>

<ul>
<li>A theory stating that specific and difficult goals with feedback lead to higher performance.</li>
<li>Components
<ul>
<li>Specificity
<ul>
<li>How much should be done in how much time? <strong>Acts as internal stimulus.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acceptance
<ul>
<li>If goals are accepted, then difficult the goal, higher the level of performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feedback
<ul>
<li>How well one is progressing toward the goal.</li>
<li>Helps reduce any deviation/discrepancy.</li>
<li>Externally or internally generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Goal commitment
<ul>

<li>They want to achieve the goal.</li>
<li>Relationship is strong when attaining goal will have some <strong>attractive outcome</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Task characteristic
<ul>
<li>Complexity
<ul>
<li>Low implies better relationship with outcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Independent vs interdependent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>National Culture
<ul>
<li>Collectivistic countries
<ul>
<li>Achievable moderate goals can be more motivating.</li>
</ul>
