### Luminous flux: 
- Total amount of light emited by a light source is called lumious fux.

- SI Unit: Lumen 
  - Equals to amount of light emited per second in a unit solid angle of one steradian from a uniform source of one candela.
  
### Luminous intensity: 
- The amount of light goes in particluar direction in particluar solid angle is called luminous intensity.
- solid angle measured in steradian
- Tells us the brightness of light in particular direction

- SI Unit: Candela
   - Luminous power per unit solid angle emited by a point light source in a particular direction
   - It is independent of distance but solid angle matters

### Illumination: 
- How much light is falling on a surface 
- SI Unit: Lux
- 1 Lux = 1 Lumen / m^2

### Foot Candle
- A unit of illuminance or illumination.
- Equal to the illumination produced by a source of one candle at a distance of one foot 
- Also equal to 1 lumen incident per square foot

### Colour Temperature
- Tells us the colour of light(either warm or cool lights).
- Unit: Kelvins
- Light emits: Warm: Orangish white, yellowish white: Colour Temperature is low
- Light emits: Cool: White : Colour Temperature is high
- Light emits: Daylight : Colour Temperature is very high

  - From 2000K to 3000K, the light produced is called “warm white” and ranges from orange to yellow-white in appearance.
  - From 3100K and 4500K are referred to as “cool white” or “bright white.” Light bulbs within this range will emit a more neutral white light and may even have a slightly blue tint.
  - Above 4500K brings us into the “daylight” color temperature of light. Light bulbs with color temperatures of 4500K and above will give off a blue-white light that mimics daylight.

- It all depends on the total amount of exposure.
    - Eg: 50 lux for 400 hr = 50lux x 400 hr = 20000 LuxHr(LH) -> Damage more
    -  100 lux for 100 hr = 100lux x 100 hr = 10000 LuxHr(LH) -> Damage less than above
    -  So in museum sometimes they switch of the lights.
  
### Controlling daylight
- Eliminate all direct sunlight.
- Keep light-sensitive objects away from windows.
- Apply solar control film, which has a tinting effect, to all windows and skylights.
- Use net curtains, Venetian blinds or calico blinds, which are useful if tinting adversely affects the appearance of old buildings.
- Block off light using black-out blinds.

### Controlling artificial light
- Using low-wattage bulbs
- Reducing the number of lamps
- Diffusing the light
- Using dimmer switches

### Reducing the length of exposure
- Putting items into storage once they have reached their annual recommended lux hours
- Changing displays regularly, rotating items from storage
- Turning pages of books and illuminated manuscripts regularly
- Fitting curtains to display cases
- Fitting time switches to artificial lighting
- Installing movement sensors that switch lights on only when someone is in the room
- Excluding all light when the museum is closed using curtains or blinds. This is particularly relevant in summer when daylight hours are much longer and could expose your items for far longer than is necessary

### Why use daylight in museums?
- Better Color Rendering
- Fuller Spectrum(VIBGYOR)
- Connection to the outside
- Problem: - It depends on type of day. If it is a cloudy then it will be gloomy.
- But one good thing is that it gives better colour rendering index(CRI).
- CRI- Color Rendering Index is degree of color shift objects undergo when illuminated by the light source as compared with a color of those same objects undergo when illuminated by a reference source of comparable color temperature 
- If CRI = 100% -> See object in perfect colour
- CRI < 70% -> See object in false colour
- CRI(museum) = 80-100% or 90-100% -> gets true colour
- Eg: Foundation Beyeler, Switzerland, Tate Modern, London, UK , The Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, TX
 

### Conservation Considerations
- Exposure to sunlight
    - Generally, all direct sunlight should be avoided.
    - Shading systems can allow diffuse light and block  all direct sunlight

- Exposure to diffuse daylight
- Exposure to UV
  - Limit by using UV filters in  glazing

### Eliminating non-visible radiation
1. Ultraviolet radiation
- Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is invisible, so it needs to be carefully monitored. 
- Given the advances in anti-UV technology, items can be affected by as little as 10 microwatts of ultraviolet per one lumen of light. Both daylight and artificial light emit UV radiation. Its short wavelength is the most damaging component of light to museum artifacts.
- There are many tools museums can employ to combat this invisible threat, including some of the following materials:
     - Laminated glass, self-adhesive film and other UV-absorbing materials such as varnish and acrylics for windows, skylights and display cases 
     - UV-absorbing sleeves and filters for artificial light sources 
     - Lamps and tubes with a low ultraviolet emission
     - White paints, based on titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Light reflected by a white painted wall contains less than 20% of its original amount of UV radiation. Whitewash (chalk) is not effective
     - Each of these materials has varying life expectancy, so keep monitoring how effective they are. Laminated glass lasts the longest, while you should check with your seller to see if their films and filters are appropriate for use museums.
     
2. Infrared Radiation
- Many light sources emit infrared radiation, which we cannot see but we feel in the form of heat. Tungsten lights are famously inefficient. A 100 watt bulb could use 94% of its electricity for heat.
- Hot display cases or rooms can cause fluctuations in relative humidity and damage collections in the process. Such radiation should, therefore, be managed and controlled efficiently.
- Here are some tips on controlling heat from light:
    - Mount lights at a safe distance from museum objects, preferably outside display cases.
    - Use 'cool-beam' lamps, that reflect heat back but allow visible light through.
    - Install fibre-optic lights, which bring light from an external heat source, thus automatically filtering out both UV and infrared radiation.
    - Planning for infrared radiation is essential when designing a lighting system for museums and galleries. Consult professional museum designers and conservators before investing in lights. Ensure that every lighting system meets museum standards.

### Artifcial Source of lighting
Requirement of an artificial lighting is: - not generate heat and UV
1. Incandescent light
- An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). 
- Electric energy -> Heat -> Light energy
- The filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or a vacuum. 
- In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal onto the filament, thereby extending its life.
- It is very inefficient mode of lighting.
3. Fluorescent Light
- A fluorescent lamp, or fluorescent tube, is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp that uses fluorescence to produce visible light. 
- It is real source of UV.
- An electric current in the gas excites mercury vapor, which produces short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor coating on the inside of the lamp to glow. 
- A fluorescent lamp converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps. 
- The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.
**Note: You can get UV light through a filter layer of polycarbonate sheet** 
4. Fibre Optics
- The light in a fiber-optic cable travels through the cable (hallway) by constantly bouncing from the cladding (mirror-lined walls), a principle called total internal reflection. 
- Because the cladding does not absorb any light from the core, the light wave can travel great distances.
- When angle of refraction becomes more than critical angle then internal reflection occurs.
- Here, UV and heat are blocked at the generator.
5. LED
- A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. 
- Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. So repulsion is caused.
- The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor

- P-N semiconductor 
   - P-type conductor : Hole concentration conductor
   - N-type conductor : Electron concentration conductor
- It is a combination of a P-type semiconductor (larger hole concentration) with an N-type semiconductor (larger electron concentration). Applying a sufficient forward voltage will cause the electrons and holes to recombine at the P-N junction, releasing energy in the form of light.
- LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) convert electrical energy directly into light, delivering efficient light generation with little-wasted electricity.
