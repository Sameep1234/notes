## Judgement and Attribution Theory

> Recap: Behaviour is defined as observable actions.

> The key question that we are are trying to answer is that whether any behaviour shown by the individual could be **attributed** to internal or external factors.

- To answer the question, we need to ask the following three high priority questions so as to make any valid judgement.
  - How does this person behave in **different situations**?
  - How do **others** behaving in **similar situations**?
  - How this person behaved **over time** in a **similar situations**?

> Inferences based on the above three questions
>
> - **Distinctiveness** - Assess the **individual** for different **situations** and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the external attribution and vice versa.
> - **Consensurs** - **Compare** with **others** and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the external attribution and vice versa.
> - **Consistency** - Same individual **always behaved** over time and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the internal attribution and vice versa.
> - Easy way to remember this is **DISCCO CAB**.

## Judgement and Shortcuts

- Necessary conditions for making judgement.
  - Information about all the three elements.
  - But many times we dont have that and at that time, you should have motivation and time for finding them.
  - So we essentially assume and shortcuts and sometimes leads to error.

## Errors and Biases in Perception

- Fundamental Attribution Error
  - This happens when we are judging **others** and **not ourselves.**
  - Here, we tend to **underestimate** the **influence of external factors** and **overestimate** hte **influence of internal factors.**
- Self-Serving Biad
  - This happens when we are judging **ourselves** and **not others.**
  - This is a complete opposite of fundamental attribution error.
  - Whenever we are successful, we tend to attribute it to **internal factors** and vice versa.

## Shortcuts in Judging Others

- Selective Percepton
  - Tendency to **choose** to interpret what one sees based on one's interest, experience, attitude and background.
  - Eg. We don't read each and every news that comes on the feed, we **choose** to read only those that interests us.
- Halo Effects
  - Halo means angel which is ususally represented by a yellow circle above his head.
  - It is the tendency to draw a **positive general impression** about an individual/product based on a single characteristic.
  - Eg. People prefering apple products are not concerned with the competition and the features avaible in other phones and at what price and thus are **operating under the halo effect.**
- Horn Effects
  - Horns usually represent devil.
  - It is the tendency to draw a **negative general impression** about an individual/product based on a single characteristic.
  - Eg. Mother/daughter in law case.
- Stereotyping
  - It means that we are judging someone based on one's **perception of the group.**
  - Eg. Being from Gujarat means that you are very good in business or have a entrepreneurial nature.
