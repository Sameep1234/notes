<blockquote>
<p>Recap: Behaviour is defined as observable actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The key question that we are are trying to answer is that whether any behaviour shown by the individual could be <strong>attributed</strong> to internal or external factors.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To answer the question, we need to ask the following three high priority questions so as to make any valid judgement.
<ul>
<li>How does this person behave in <strong>different situations</strong>?</li>
<li>How do <strong>others</strong> behaving in <strong>similar situations</strong>?</li>
<li>How this person behaved <strong>over time</strong> in a <strong>similar situations</strong>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Inferences based on the above three questions</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinctiveness</strong> - Assess the <strong>individual</strong> for different <strong>situations</strong> and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the external attribution and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Consensurs</strong> - <strong>Compare</strong> with <strong>others</strong> and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the external attribution and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong> - Same individual <strong>always behaved</strong> over time and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the internal attribution and vice versa.</li>
<li>Easy way to remember this is <strong>DISCCO CAB</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Necessary conditions for making judgement.
<ul>
<li>Information about all the three elements.</li>
<li>But many times we dont have that and at that time, you should have motivation and time for finding them.</li>
<li>So we essentially assume and shortcuts and sometimes leads to error.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fundamental Attribution Error
<ul>
<li>This happens when we are judging <strong>others</strong> and <strong>not ourselves.</strong></li>
<li>Here, we tend to <strong>underestimate</strong> the <strong>influence of external factors</strong> and <strong>overestimate</strong> hte <strong>influence of internal factors.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-Serving Biad
<ul>
<li>This happens when we are judging <strong>ourselves</strong> and <strong>not others.</strong></li>
<li>This is a complete opposite of fundamental attribution error.</li>
<li>Whenever we are successful, we tend to attribute it to <strong>internal factors</strong> and vice versa.</li>

<ul>
<li>Selective Percepton
<ul>
<li>Tendency to <strong>choose</strong> to interpret what one sees based on one's interest, experience, attitude and background.</li>
<li>Eg. We don't read each and every news that comes on the feed, we <strong>choose</strong> to read only those that interests us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Halo Effects
<ul>
<li>Halo means angel which is ususally represented by a yellow circle above his head.</li>
<li>It is the tendency to draw a <strong>positive general impression</strong> about an individual/product based on a single characteristic.</li>
<li>Eg. People prefering apple products are not concerned with the competition and the features avaible in other phones and at what price and thus are <strong>operating under the halo effect.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Horn Effects
<ul>
<li>Horns usually represent devil.</li>
<li>It is the tendency to draw a <strong>negative general impression</strong> about an individual/product based on a single characteristic.</li>
<li>Eg. Mother/daughter in law case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stereotyping
<ul>
<li>It means that we are judging someone based on one's <strong>perception of the group.</strong></li>
<li>Eg. Being from Gujarat means that you are very good in business or have a entrepreneurial nature.</li>
</ul>
