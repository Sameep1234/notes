## Degradtion of ceramics due to soluble salts

* **Similar to salt crystalization in stones.**

## Damage due to water

## Deterioration of wood
* Physical
* Cracking
* Warping
    * Wood has anisotropic property (directional property --> Different shrinkage in different directions)
    * It shrinks and twist and this is called warping.
* Waterlogging
* Fire, light and UV Radtions
    * Breaks the cellulose chains

* **Presence of lignin decides whether the wood is hard of soft as lignin is the binding agent. If lignin is more, wood is hard and vice versa.**
* Biological Degration
    * Fungi, bacteria or insects etc damage wood to a lot extent.
* Chemical Degration
    * High acidic or alkaline conditions breaks the chains.
* Polychrome wood is colored/painted wood and you have several layers and the uneven expansion and contrction leads to damage and cracks will develop in painted surface.
* Created by adding layer of wood, then cloth, then paper and finally ground (chalk + glue).

## Deterioration in metals
* Physical Deformation
* Patination
    * Patina is surface layer formation.
    * This surface layer includes oxide layers, chloride layers etc.
    * Noble and malignant patina
    * Copper oxides and carbonates are noble patina.
    * Iron oxides are corrosive in nature as they are porous.
* Corrosion
    * The process of decay of metal by environmental attack is known as corrosion.
    * It is an oxidation process and is a reverse process of metal extraction.
    * Types
        * Dry
            * Direct chemical action of environment on the surface of metal in absense of moisture
            * Eg. Tarnishing of silver
            * It takes place due to chemical action of atmospheric gases. 
        * Wet/Electrochemical/Galvanic
            * Direct chemical action of environment on the surface of metal in presence of conducting liquid with the formation of electrochemical cells.

    * Corrosion in bronze
    * First Paratacamite is formed (unstable).
    * Then Atacamite is formed (stable).
    * Then Nantokite is formed (very stable).
        * This is also called as **Bronze disease and is very important.**

## Extra Points
* Cellulose is long and linear chain.
* Hemicellulose is short and branched chain.
