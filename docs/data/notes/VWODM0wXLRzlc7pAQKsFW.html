<ul>
<li>Job satisfaction is the positive feeling that we associate with our jobs.</li>
<li>To measure it we have two methods
<ul>
<li>Global rating which just asks one question that all things considered, how satisfied are you with your jobs?</li>
<li>Very quick</li>
<li>Summation of key aspects
<ul>
<li>Type of work, skills needed, supervision, pay, growth, culture etc.</li>
<li>Very detailed but time consuming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two worlds
<ul>
<li>Empirical i.e the visible world.</li>
<li>Conceptual i.e virtual world.</li>
<li>We can see empirical world and make inferences about conceptual world but it can't be reversed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Intention to leave the organization.</li>
<li>Positive relationship between leaving and dissatisfaction.</li>

<li>It is high in places with higher job options.</li>
<li><strong>Push and pull effect</strong>
<ul>
<li>Something happens that makes the sense of injustice even more stronger and you are pushed to leave the organization is called push effect.</li>
<li>Pull effect means individual is not seeking other job currently even though he or she is dissatisfied with the job.</li>
<li>But then competitors approach them and ask to leave their job is called pull effect.</li>
</ul>
