<ul>
<li>Dendrochronology
<ul>
<li>Used to estimate age of wooden artifacts.</li>
<li>Every year wood grows a ring and by calculating the ring, the age of wood can be guessed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dendroclimatology tells you the environment type of climate. It helps in estimating date as well as the climate.
<ul>
<li>If it is the ring means less precipitation and if it is thick then it indicated flood or very good precipitation.</li>
<li>Very thin means drought like situation.</li>
<li>Some burn scars means that a particular year had some fire events etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Obsidian is an extrusive igneous rock and called as volcanic glass because it does not have porosity.</li>
<li>It is so dense and hence it is called volcanic glass.</li>
<li>Only useful to date obsidian based objects (quite obvious).</li>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-12-02-01-39-39.png"></li>
<li>Gathers the layer of water on surface when viewed under a microscope.</li>
<li>Since there is no porosity, the water does not get absorbed. Instead, it gets adsorbed.</li>
<li>We have no idea when this water/moisture started to get adsorbed. It is possible that it might have started a 1000 years back.</li>
<li>If there is any scratch or crack on the stone, the fresh surface is exposed.</li>
<li>This fresh surface will not have any amount of moisture present.</li>
<li>But after the crack has been formed, moisture starts to accumulate and form hydration rim or rind.</li>
<li>When taken under a high magnifying microscope, we can measure the thickness of the water rim and as a result calculate the age of the artifact.</li>

<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-12-02-01-46-24.png"></li>
<li>Used for dating of stone materials especially igneous rocks like granite.</li>
<li>'K' has some isotopes present.
<ul>
<li><img src="/notes/assets/images/2021-12-02-01-48-07.png"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Argon is inert/noble gas and does not take part in any chemical reaction.</li>
<li>When lava is in molten state, potassium and argon are present.</li>
<li>As molten lava gets solidified, argon starts escaping as it is an inert material and does not want to get involved in any reactions.</li>
<li>When the rock has solidified completely, there was no presence of argon.</li>
<li>This radioactive potassium goes into a beta-decay and form two kind of products.</li>
<li>When neutron changes to proton, atomic number gets incremented by 1 while mass number remains the same.</li>
<li>This means calcium is formed and it does not escape.</li>
<li>Now if proton changes to neutron, the mass number remains same but atomic number decrements by 1.</li>
<li>This means argon is formed.</li>
<li>Note that initially argon was not there as it had escaped. But now, argon is present as a result of beta-decay.</li>
<li>So this argon will tell us the age of igneous rock.</li>
<li>So if you take the ratio of Argon to original potassium, you can determine the age of the rock.</li>

<ul>
<li>Ways to examin artifacts
<ul>
<li>Under normal light.</li>
<li>Under UV light.
<ul>
<li>When exposed under UV light, the old material and new material will florence differently.</li>
<li>This means that the older material will be brighter whereas newer material will be darker.</li>
<li>Used in finerprinting process.
<ul>
<li>Suppose there is a sculpture in which hand is broken and you have attached a new hand in such a way that no one can know that hand was broken.</li>
<li>So it will become very difficult to authenticate this sculpture and hence this process can be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is also helpful in identifying coutnerfeit products

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under infrared radiation.
<ul>
<li>Also helps in fingerprinting a artifact.</li>
<li>Problem here is that it does not lie in visible range.</li>
<li>So you have to look at some monitor type device to see the infrared rays.</li>
<li>These rays have a property of penetrating although less deeper than radio waves etc.</li>
<li>Suppose what is behind/underneath the painting or object, we can see through IR.</li>
