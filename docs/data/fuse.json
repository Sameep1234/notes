It would all be automated and done by github actions.\r\n* Steps\r\n    * Go to github actions tab on the site.\r\n    * Click create new workflow.\r\n    * Under the continuous integration workflows, click more  continuous integration workflows.\r\n    * Select the **Python application** and click set up this workflow.\r\n        * name: Self-explanatory\r\n        * on: when do you want to trigger the scripts\r\n        * push: Implies that the scripts will trigger on push\r\n        * branches: On which branch shall the \"event\" (push, pull etc) occur, so as to trigger CI workflow.\r\n        * jobs: **Most important part.**\r\n        * build: We specify whether we are building or deploying (write deploy instead of build to let it know that its a deploy script)\r\n        * runs-on: Remote desktop offered by **github.**\r\n        * steps: Self-explanatory\r\n        * uses: preferable keep it actions/checkout@v2.

To acheive the same, we need to attach the strain guage in such a fashion that the value of R3 decreases.\r\n- Only if R3 decreases will the drop increase.\r\n- Now to further increase the sensitivity, we use strain guage in place of R1 and R2 also.\r\n- The manner of attaching the strain guage gets reversed because we want to decrease the value of R1 to increase the value of potential drop.\r\n- Types of bridges\r\n  - Quater - Only one strain guage is used.\r\n  - Half - Two strain guages are used.\r\n  - Full - Four starain guages are used.\r\n- Note that we should use the same/identical strain guages for (R4, R3) pair and (R1, R2) because the strain resistance is a function of temperature also and we want the conditions to be almost similar for both the strain guages.\r\n- This is also the reason as to why three strain guages are not used in a bridge.

Timer)\r\n  - Plant (Eg. Heating coil)\r\n- Type of control system\r\n  - Open Loop: Control action is independent of the control variable.\r\n    - We must assume the timer setting to be correct.\r\n    - Block Diagram\r\n      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-09-13.png)\r\n  - Closed Loop: Control action is dependent of the control variable.\r\n    - User will have manual control.\r\n    - Feedback recieved with the help of human senses. Can also be used as feedback in automatic control systems. For this, the feedback has to be electrical.\r\n    - This means that the control action depends on the output variable.\r\n  - There are various other factors which can't be known and hence are assumed to be constant. For example, ageing and changes in load weight. \r\n  - The main difference between open loop and close loop system is of feedback which is not present in open loop system.\r\n\r\n## Steady state calculation\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-20-17.png)\r\n\r\n- A is the gain of the amplifier. It is dimensionless. Also called as the loop gain.\r\n- Km is the motor constant. Upto Km, we will get the **speed** of the motor.\r\n- Ks is the sensor constant. Speed sensors input is speed and output is voltage. Dimension of Ks is opposite tso that of Km. Ks = $\\\\frac{Vf}{N}$.\r\n- N = speed in rpm.\r\n- A_Km_Ks is called the loop gain of the system. So larger its value, the smaller is the difference and hence we get almost equal value to Vs.\r\n- So it is better to obtain loop gain of 100 and it is achievable.\r\n\r\n## Specification of control systems\r\n\r\n- Accuracy of output in steady state.\r\n- Speed of response.\r\n- Feedback (Improves both).\r\n  - Because of this, the effective time constant is reduced and hence speed and accuracy is improved.\r\n\r\n## Steps in analysis of control system\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-49-06.png)\r\n\r\n## Example of Oven\r\n\r\n- Block Diagram\r\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-39-38.png)\r\n- The rate of increase depends on thermal resistance and thermal capacitance.\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-42-28.png)\r\n- Heat flow is in watts.

This might take time which is greater than the allocated one.\r\n- So in the middle of the execution of a process, dispatcher stops the execution and decides which process should go next.\r\n- Once decided, either execution of new process starts or execution of old process continues.\r\n- Then, suppose there is an I/O request. Since this is a slow operation, the dispatcher will allow another process to run on the processor.\r\n- This goes on and on untill all the processes are executed.\r\n\r\n> The above method is from **processor POV** and is called **interleaving of processes** and the OS manages this through **dispatcher**.

Since there are two types of processes, one who did not terminate but their allocated time got over and others who are waiting for I/O or other resouces.\r\n- This, in turn is the 5-state process model.\r\n- Total states in this model\r\n  - New - Process that has just been created but not admitted to the pool of the ready state processes.\r\n    - **Not loaded in main memory but is created.**\r\n    - This means that PCB for that process has been created but its corresponding data and program has not been loaded/created in the main memory.\r\n  - Ready\r\n  - Blocked/Waiting\r\n  - Running\r\n  - Exit (Earlier it was not a state but now it is) - Process which has been released from the pool of processes.\r\n    - However, there is some part of PCB left in main memory for accounting.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-32-07.png)\r\n\r\n## State Transitions\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-36-29.png)\r\n\r\n- Ready and Blocked process can enter directly to exit state when its parent process has terminated or the process is terminated by the OS.\r\n\r\n- When process spawning occurs, then child process is created in the new state.\r\n\r\n- Hang state is equivalent to blocked/waiting state.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Blocked Queue\r\n\r\n- Suppose there are 10 processes which are in blocked queue waiting for HDD to get accesible and there are 90 processes that are in hang mode.\r\n- Now once HDD is ready to be accessed, OS will have to search this blocked queue and move all these processes to ready state.\r\n- This is again time consuming and complex.

This is called short burst or quantum of computation.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-00-06-36.png)\r\n\r\n## OS Structure\r\n\r\n- _For general purpose OS, the program is very large._\r\n- Ways to structure OS\r\n  - Monolitic Approach (Analofy coding in C where there are no classes) - Everything combined in one place.\r\n    - Eg. Older LINUX and UNIX\r\n    - Advantages\r\n      - Speed as everything is connected\r\n      - Performance\r\n    - Disadvantages\r\n      - Difficult to maintain and modify\r\n  - Layered Approach - OS divided into number of layers.\r\n    - Layer 0 = hardware and Layer n = user interface layer\r\n    - A particular layer can use functions and services of **lower-level layers only (layers below it).**\r\n    - Eg. Older windows versions\r\n  - Microkernels - Move as much functionalities as possible to user mode from kernel mode. \r\n    - Unlike that in layered and monolithic where majority of the functionalities is available in only kernal mode.\r\n    - I\\\\O and interrupt management, primitive memory management, inter-process communication and basic scheduling were kept in kernel mode.\r\n    - All other functionalities will be running in user mode.\r\n    - Advantages\r\n      - Time is reduced significantly as the time to change the mode from user to kernel and vice versa is almost completely diminished.\r\n      - Porting of OS to newer architecture becomes easier (will be covered in upcoming lectures).\r\n      - More reliable because less code is running in kernel mode.\r\n      - More secure as less code has to be valudated in kernel.\r\n    - Disadvantages\r\n      - Performance overhead to change the mode.\r\n    - Eg. Mach, MINIX, Windows NT Client-Server\r\n  - Modules - Most moedern OS implement kernel modules\r\n    - These are loadable kernel module\r\n    - Uses OOP\r\n    - Similar to layers but is more flexible\r\n    - Eg. Device Drivers (These are loaded as needed within the kernel)\r\n    - Solaris Modular Approach (will be covered in upcoming lectures).\r\n  - Hybrid Approach - Combines multiple approaches to address performance, security and usability.\r\n    - Eg. Linux and Solaris = monolithich + modular, windows = monolithic + microkernel and Mac OS and IOS = Darwin which is microkernel and BSD Unix kernel implemented over layered model\r\n\r\n","n":0.035}}},{"i":27,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lecture 15","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\r\n## Producer/Consumer (Cont.)\r\n\r\n> The question was what would happen if we changed the order in which semaphores are released?\r\n\r\n* Assume that in consumer, we are waiting for delay to restore.

![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-19-32.png)\r\n  - Suppose process 0 needs to enter into critical section every hour and process 1 needs to enter the critical section 1000 times in an hour.\r\n  - Now, it is suppose process 0 exits the critical section and allows process 1 to enter.\r\n  - turn variable is set 0 for the next 1 hour because process 0 is not going to go in the critical section.\r\n  - This means that process 1 will suffer.\r\n  - Secondly, if one process fails, the other process is permanently blocked.\r\n- Attempt 2\r\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-24-37.png)\r\n  - In this attempt, we continuously check the flag of other process and if it is false, then only enter the critical section.\r\n  - Furthermore, lock the critical section by toggling the flag and once the process leaves the critical section, toggle the flag to free the critical section for other processes.\r\n  - Lets say process 0 gets switched after executing the first line.\r\n  - The problem is obvious then. **We can't acheive mutual exclusion.**\r\n- Attempt 3\r\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-42-42.png)\r\n  -

Electron affinity is energy gained by putting an electron in (from vacuum) and by convention it is negative.\r\n\r\n> Electronegativity is the measure of how likely an atom will take up or give up an electron.\r\n\r\n- Valence electrons determine the physical properties viz chemical, electrical, thermal and optical\r\n- Electropositive elements easily give up electrons to become positive ions. These generally rest in the left sife of the periodic table and vice versa for electronegative elements.\r\n- This means electronegativity is smaller on left side and larger on the right side.\r\n\r\n## Physical properties in Periodic table\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-08-27.png)\r\n\r\n## Bonding in solids\r\n\r\n- At large distances, interactions are negligible and at small distances each atom exerts forces on the other.\r\n- These include, force of attraction and that of repulsion.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-12-56.png)\r\n\r\n- Fnet = Fr + Fa.

This means that it is the energy required to seperate two atoms to an infinite seperation.\r\n- It the curve above is deep, this implies that the material is rigid and inflexible and vice versa.\r\n- If the double derivative of the energy (equivalent to single derivative of force equation) equation at r = r0 is less than 0 then it is stable and vice versa.\r\n- To find the equalibrium position, make the single derivative of the energy equation (equivalent to the force equation) equal to 0.\r\n- The mechanical stiffness (elasticity) of a material is dependent on the shapr of its F vs r diagram.\r\n- Steep curve means relatively stiff and vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Ionic Bonding\r\n\r\n- Generally takes place between metals and non-metals. There is a complete transfer of electron.\r\n- **Difference between electronegativity is of prime importance. Ionic bonding only occurs between atoms with large differences in electronegativity.**\r\n- Cation = Positive Ion, Anion = Negative Ion\r\n- Primary Bonding means that electrons are completely transferred. Atoms do so to acheive stable configuration. Such type of bonding is very strong (columbic force in case of ionic bonding). (Eg. Ionic, Covalent and Metallic)\r\n- Ionic bonds are non-directional whereas covalent bonds are directional in nature. **Non-directional means that the magnitude of bond is equal in all directions around an ion.**\r\n- Secondary Bonding means that electrons are shared. This type of bonding is weaker compared to primary bonding. (Eg. inert gases (H2, Cl2) or permanet dipoles (H20, HCl))\r\n- Enet (due to all attractions and repulsions) is known as **madelung energy**.\r\n- The predominant bonding in **ceramic materials** is **ionic.**\r\n\r\n## Covalent Bonding\r\n\r\n- **Covalent bonding occurs between atoms with small differences in electronegativity.**\r\n- The stable electroninc configuration is achieved by **sharing of electrons**.\r\n- Generally occur between non-metals and is directional bond.\r\n- Number of colvalent bonds is determined by the number of valence electrons.\r\n- Percent of ionic characters:\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-46-57.png)\r\n\r\n- Here Xa and Xb are the electronegativities of elements a and b. Greater the difference between electronegativities, greater is the ionic bonding and vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Metallic Bonding\r\n\r\n- Found in metals and their alloys.\r\n- According to the model presented, the valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom in the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal.\r\n- Thus, these are called as electron clound as the electrons are all over the metal.\r\n- The remaining non-valence electrons and nucleus form the ion core and **posses a net positive charge** equal to total valence electrons charge per atom.\r\n- The free electrons sheild the positively charged ion cores from mutually repulsive electrostatic forces along with acting as a **glue**.\r\n- Because of the availability of free electrons, metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity.\r\n\r\n## Van der waals bodning\r\n\r\n- All the above mentioned bonds are **primary** bonds and this type of bond is **secondary** in nature.\r\n- It is weaker as compared to primary bonds.\r\n- It is virtually ubiquitous but presence of primary bonds diminishes their effect.\r\n- Usually found between **inert gases**.\r\n- Dipoles are formed which exists whenever there is some separation of positive and negative portions of an atom or molecule.\r\n- Hydrogen bonding is a special type of secondary bonding that exists metweeb some molecules that have hydrogen as one of its constituents.\r\n\r\n## Summary of Bonding\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-50-27.png)\r\n\r\n","n":0.033}}},{"i":42,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lecture 1","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\r\n## Introduction to Material Science and Engineering\r\n\r\n## Points to Ponder\r\n\r\n- With slight change in physical properties, we can get a whole new material.

After multiple iterations a child knows that when a telephone rings, we pick it up and talk.

Child born in a tribe and in a modern family.\r\n  - The difference between learning language in modern family and that in tribe would be of written documentation.\r\n  - Tribe people might not have a written manuscript of the symbols and language that they use whereas modern family have perfectly well maintained documentation of the rules and regulations of their language.\r\n  - Thus, a child in tribe might learn about only the spoken part and not the written part whearas in modern family, a child learns both.\r\n- Social elements\r\n  - Symbols\r\n  - Knowledge\r\n  - Ideas\r\n  - Mode of reasoning\r\n\r\n## Difference in perspective of both theories\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-11-44-22.png)\r\n- In the above example, from piaget's perspective, the child discovered the rule of commutativity because the child acted on the pebbles (physical environment) and while playing with it.\r\n- From the vigotsky's perspective, the child belongs to the community where they know how to count or at least that community value counting because of which the child started counting.\r\n- Otherwise, the child could have done numerous other activities with the pebbles like throwing it, catching it etc.\r\n- This also means that the community also has some symbols that facilitate counting.

This immense heating causing chemically binded water to detach from the clay making it very hard.\r\n- **Note that the temperature when firing the clay should be raised slowly and not drastically.**\r\n- This is because clay is porous and when firing, chemically bonded water will try to escape. Now, if suddenly the temperature is raised then the chemically bonded water will not escape suddenly.\r\n- Instead, the silica fuses into one another trapping the chemically bonded water.\r\n- Now, at high temperatures, these chemically bonded water turns into steam creating air bubbles.\r\n- As a result, the clay will disintegrate immediately. Same applies for cooling too. You have to cool the clay very slowly.\r\n\r\n## Colors of material at different temperature\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-10.png)\r\n\r\n## Quartz Inversion Temperature\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-43.png)\r\n- Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2) and has a trigonal crystalline structure called as alpha-quartz.\r\n- At 573 degrees it gets converted into beta-quartz which is hexagonal in shape.\r\n- So now, it holds clay at 6 points unlike earlier where it holded clay at only 3 points.\r\n- Now, because of this beta-quartz, the properties of silica change and thus, becomes impervious to water damage.\r\n- Now, if we cool the clay as soon as it reached 573 degrees, only some part of clay will get converted and majority will disintegrate as soon as it comes in contact of water.\r\n- Therfore, it is of vital importance that we keep the clay at least equal to 573 degrees for about 2-3 hrs. It depends on how big is the pot.\r\n- Finally, after quartz inversion takes place, clay turns into ceramics.\r\n\r\n## Sintering\r\n\r\n- This is the next phase of clay firing starting at 900 degrees.\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-33-49.png)\r\n- **After this phase, the water will be retained because of fusion of clay particles.**\r\n- Pores get removed due to exertion of pressure on each silica particle.\r\n- This process is called **solid phase sintering.**\r\n\r\n## Vitrification\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-41-09.png)\r\n- After solid phase sintering, there might be some pores that are still left which may allow water to pass.\r\n- Thus, this next phase is crucial to cover all the pores.\r\n- In order to lower the melting point of silica, flux is added.\r\n- Flux is **glassy** in nature. In fact, vitri means glass case.\r\n- Flux are oxides of metals like calcium, sodian, magnesium, lead, potassion, manganese etc.\r\n- Now, these oxides (in power form) melt at 1600 degrees and form a liquid.\r\n- This liquid flows into the pores and solidifies there making the clay fully impervious.\r\n- This process is called **liquid phase sintering.**\r\n- **Here, note that silica particles are not melting. It is the flux that is melting.**\r\n\r\n## Glazing\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-52-17.png)\r\n- It beautifies clay by giving it a feel of glass.\r\n- **Vitreous means glassy.**\r\n\r\n## Summary of stages of clay\r\n\r\n- Quartz inversion\r\n- Solid phase sintering\r\n- Liquid phase sintering (vitrification).\r\n- This turns clay to ceramics.\r\n- Glaze\r\n\r\n## Extra Points\r\n\r\n- Melting point of silica = 2000 degress.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n## Wood\r\n\r\n- This is an organic material and is found in nature.\r\n- Made from cellulose and bio-organisms can decay these materials.\r\n- Carving would be easier on wood rather than that on stone because wood is way more softer than stone.\r\n- Wood is higly porous.\r\n\r\n## Surfaces of wood\r\n\r\n- Inlay\r\n  - Insertion of stone by making a fine cut in the wood.\r\n- Paint\r\n- Varnish\r\n- Gilded\r\n  - Gold leaf is applied with plaster like substance (to provide adhesiveness to gold leaf) to give wood a appearance of metal.\r\n- Lacquer\r\n  - Dip the material in lac which develop aesthetic cracks.\r\n\r\n## Important timbers\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-01.png)\r\n\r\n## Types of wood\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-47.png)\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-11-49.png)\r\n\r\n## Components of wood\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-12-21.png)\r\n- If all the water is lost from the wood, then the wood would shrink and vice versa.\r\n- The exansion and contraction takes place in wood to a great extent.

(SiO2 and Al2O3).\r\n- When you introduce water, clay becomes really soft and it disintegrates easily.\r\n- To overcome this problem, we heat the clay at very high temperature and as a result, it becomes very hard and dense.\r\n- So basically, on heating we are removing water and hence it looses its plasticity.\r\n- Terracotta army\r\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-02-41.png)\r\n  - Terra means earth\r\n  - Terracota is basically fired clay.\r\n  - Brick is made of terracota.\r\n- BASIC Materials\r\n- Stucco is made from unbaked clay or sunbaked clay. It is not fired but is sunbaked and hence becomes crucial to study.\r\n- It is majorly found in Gandhara, Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n## Types of clay\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-15-46.png)\r\n- Terracota comes under erathenware. It gets red color due to inclusion of iron.\r\n- Bone china is a type of porcelain and fired at 1350 degrees and is mostly white in color.\r\n- White colored clay called kaolin is used to make bone china.\r\n\r\n## Stages of clay\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-18-04.png)\r\n- Bisuqe is also called as bicuit firing and is the first firing stage.\r\n\r\n## Extra Points\r\n\r\n- When you keep on heating/firing any material, the ultimate color it will emit will always be white.\r\n- This happens because of the stages of heating. In the first stage, the carbon layer is burnt and is black in color.\r\n- Now on further increasing the temperature, you will see orange color and then becomes red and then it becomes ash colored (grey) and finally becomes white.\r\n\r\n","n":0.044}}},{"i":70,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lecture 5","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\r\n## Patina and Metal Oxide\r\n\r\n## Patina Continued.\r\n\r\n- Any layer that is formed on the metal surface is called patina.\r\n- Layers\r\n  - Oxide\r\n  - Carbonate\r\n  - Sulphate\r\n  - Acetate\r\n  - Chloride\r\n- Those patina which is protective in nature is called noble patina and those that are corrosive in nature are called malignant patina.\r\n- Cuprous oxide (Brown) and cupric oxide (Black) is noble patina as they do not react and protect copper metal.\r\n- Greenish layer deposited on copper is carbonate layer.\r\n  - It is also known as malachite.\r\n  - **Noble patina** but in very rare cases it is malignant patina.\r\n- **Malignant Patina (Bronze Disease)**\r\n  - Bronze metals form chloride layer (atacamite and nantokite).\r\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-00-05-28.png)\r\n    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-00-06-37.png)\r\n\r\n## Malachite and Azurite formation\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-23-50-53.png)\r\n- Two forms of carbonate layer.\r\n- Carbonate ions are formed when carbon dioxide is dissoved in water.\r\n- We may also get carbonic acid in a similar fashion.\r\n- On scratching a corroded metal, we get pure metal inside it. Now that in turn acts as anode and the corroded layer acts as cathode.\r\n- Then follow the above figure.\r\n- Oxidation number is the charge an element has in a compound/molecule.\r\n\r\n> If in the environment, if you have a lot of CO2, then what will you get? (Azurite or Malachite)\r\n>\r\n> - We will get azurite as in more CO2 concentrated areas, it is a stable carbonate layer.\r\n\r\n## Iron Oxide\r\n\r\n- Nature of Fe2O3 is unstable (doubtfull) and porous\r\n- This is malignant patina.\r\n- Because of its porosity, the inner core of the metal is always exposed and hence is called malignant patina.\r\n- **Startling fact**\r\n  - Qutub Minar is made of iron.\r\n  - Built about 1500-1600 years back.\r\n  - But still, there is no rusting.\r\n  - **In iron, a little bit of phosphorous is mixed and it forms a complex layer by reacting with hydrogen and oxygen.**\r\n  - Hence, the iron pillar does not get corroded.\r\n  - Now, phosphorous and sulphur have tendency to crack any metal (even iron) if it remains inside that metal.\r\n  - Hence, when iron is heated to 1500 degrees, phosphorous and sulphur escape and iron is protected.\r\n  - Then, with continuous hammering, the remaining phosphorous comes out on the surface of the metal and hence forms a protective layer.\r\n  - To make the pillar, a little bit of zinc was also added in the bottom/base of the pillar.\r\n  - Zinc acts as a **sacrificial anode.**\r\n  - This means that zinc will corrode and protect iron.\r\n\r\n","n":0.05}}},{"i":71,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lecture 4","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\r\n## Electrochemical series and more on metals\r\n\r\n- It is the disordered state that is stable state and ordered state is the active one.\r\n- This is because, you put some energy in the disordered state to make it in order.\r\n- Every metal, from the moment extraction is done, it wants to go to its ore form.\r\n- When a metal is corroded, rust hinders the property of metal. Thus, we can say that the non-metallic quality of metal increases.\r\n- **Magnetic effect** is used to detect how much **core metal** is left and how much **rust** is formed.\r\n\r\n## Electrochemical Series\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-24-30.png)\r\n- The metals here are placed according to their decreasing reactivity. Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.\r\n- Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.\r\n- It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.\r\n- Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations. Another reason for that use is that it is an excellent conductor of electrivity.\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-29-17.png)\r\n- Oxidation \r\n  - When a metal looses electron. \r\n  - The power to loose electron is called oxidation potential.\r\n  - Lesser reactive metals have lower oxidation potential than more reactive metals.\r\n- Reduction\r\n  - When a metal gains electron.\r\n  - The power to gain electron is called reduction potential.\r\n  - Lesser reactive metals have higher reduction potential than more reactive metals.\r\n- Reducing agent is a more reactive metal that displaces a metal from its sulfate state and vice versa.\r\n- In metallic terms, oxidation is also called corrosion.\r\n\r\n## Galvanic Cell\r\n\r\n- Also known as Voltaic cell or Daniel cell or Electrochemical cell\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-39-33.png)\r\n- Electrode is a solid electrical conductor that carries a current. Two types include anode and cathode.\r\n- Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.\r\n- Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.\r\n- Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.\r\n- This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.\r\n- So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.\r\n- **To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.**\r\n- Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.\r\n- Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection. (Used mainly for protecting silver by coating gold on it).\r\n\r\n## Tarnising of silver\r\n\r\n- Silver is almost a noble metal and hence it is very difficult for it to corrode.\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-53-23.png)\r\n- Color is black.\r\n- Oxygen can not harm silver but sulfur can.\r\n- Only on the surface.\r\n- We preserve tarnished silver to preserve silver and it also represent age and authenticity in silver artifacts.\r\n- Patina is just a layer and surface discoloration. It is a surface phenomena.\r\n- Silver sulfide layer is called as noble patina because it is non reactive.\r\n- Oxide layer on broze is blackish in color or called as blackish patina.\r\n- Cuprous oxide layer is brownish in color and later it will change to cupric oxide which is more stable and is blackish in color.\r\n\r\n## Types of oxide\r\n\r\n- Unstable metal oxide - Gold, Silver and Platinum\r\n- Stable metal oxide - Copper, Tin and Lead\r\n- Volatile metal oxide - Molebdenum\r\n- Porous metal oxide - Sodium, Potassium, Manganese and iron.\r\n\r\n","n":0.041}}},{"i":72,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lecture 3","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\r\n\r\n## Hardness of Stones and Introduction to metals\r\n\r\n## Mohs Hardness Scale\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-14-42-38.png)\r\n- Gypsum\r\n  - Used as one of the raw components of cement and its called calcium sulphate.\r\n  - It is really soft.\r\n- Calcite\r\n  - Chief component of limestone and marble.\r\n  - It is called Calcium Carbonate\r\n- Quartz\r\n  - It is very hard.\r\n  - Used in sandstone and granite\r\n  - Hence, these materials are also hard.\r\n  - It is called silicon dioxide.\r\n  - Harder than Gypsum and Calcite as evident from the above figure.\r\n  - Artifacts of sandstone have different colors like shown in below image.\r\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-05-34.png)\r\n  - This means that if **iron content** is more, then it **gives red** color and if **clay content** is more, then it **gives yellow** color.\r\n  - The red color of the red fort is red because of ferruginous sandstone.

It has dedicated 1-bit to store every flag that we may encounter.\r\n\r\n## TIFR Circuit\r\n\r\n- It is an 8-bit register.\r\n\r\n- Stores flags and **overflow flag is set on 0th bit**.\r\n\r\n- Value \"1\" implies overflowed and vice versa.\r\n  > The below given figure will be provided for reference in exam.\r\n\r\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-37-11.png)\r\n\r\n- Prescalers slows down the clock. Hence increases the time period.\r\n\r\n- Thus, multiply the prescaler to clock time period to get the adequate delay.\r\n\r\n- Overflow flag is located on 0th bit. Hence to check overflow we check TIFR & 0x1 to be 0.\r\n\r\n- **Make sure that to reset the flag by putting \"1\" to the flag.**\r\n\r\n- The reason for this could be understood using an analogy. These are not the direct registers. These like control registers which means they act as a switch. We are pressing the \"reset\" switch (by putting \"1\") and in turn it is telling the actual register to reset the values. Thus, instead of 0, we are passing 1.\r\n\r\n- Example questions\r\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-40-28.png)\r\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-42-27.png)\r\n  - Toggle bits on 4th Pin of PORTB continuously with delay of 70 microseconds.
