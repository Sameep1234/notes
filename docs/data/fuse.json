To acheive the same, we need to attach the strain guage in such a fashion that the value of R3 decreases.\n- Only if R3 decreases will the drop increase.\n- Now to further increase the sensitivity, we use strain guage in place of R1 and R2 also.\n- The manner of attaching the strain guage gets reversed because we want to decrease the value of R1 to increase the value of potential drop.\n- Types of bridges\n  - Quater - Only one strain guage is used.\n  - Half - Two strain guages are used.\n  - Full - Four starain guages are used.\n- Note that we should use the same/identical strain guages for (R4, R3) pair and (R1, R2) because the strain resistance is a function of temperature also and we want the conditions to be almost similar for both the strain guages.\n- This is also the reason as to why three strain guages are not used in a bridge.

Timer)\n  - Plant (Eg. Heating coil)\n- Type of control system\n  - Open Loop: Control action is independent of the control variable.\n    - We must assume the timer setting to be correct.\n    - Block Diagram\n      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-09-13.png)\n  - Closed Loop: Control action is dependent of the control variable.\n    - User will have manual control.\n    - Feedback recieved with the help of human senses. Can also be used as feedback in automatic control systems. For this, the feedback has to be electrical.\n    - This means that the control action depends on the output variable.\n  - There are various other factors which can't be known and hence are assumed to be constant. For example, ageing and changes in load weight. \n  - The main difference between open loop and close loop system is of feedback which is not present in open loop system.\n\n## Steady state calculation\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-20-17.png)\n\n- A is the gain of the amplifier. It is dimensionless. Also called as the loop gain.\n- Km is the motor constant. Upto Km, we will get the **speed** of the motor.\n- Ks is the sensor constant. Speed sensors input is speed and output is voltage. Dimension of Ks is opposite tso that of Km. Ks = $\\\\frac{Vf}{N}$.\n- N = speed in rpm.\n- A_Km_Ks is called the loop gain of the system. So larger its value, the smaller is the difference and hence we get almost equal value to Vs.\n- So it is better to obtain loop gain of 100 and it is achievable.\n\n## Specification of control systems\n\n- Accuracy of output in steady state.\n- Speed of response.\n- Feedback (Improves both).\n  - Because of this, the effective time constant is reduced and hence speed and accuracy is improved.\n\n## Steps in analysis of control system\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-49-06.png)\n\n## Example of Oven\n\n- Block Diagram\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-39-38.png)\n- The rate of increase depends on thermal resistance and thermal capacitance.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-42-28.png)\n- Heat flow is in watts.

Parent and Child processes.\n- Enable synchronization among processes.\n\n## Process\n\n- Program in execution.\n- Instance of program running\n- Entity that can be assigned to and executed on a processor\n- **Unit of activity defined by program, its states and its associated resources.**\n- Process Elements\n  - Program code (generally shared)\n  - Set of data\n  - Attributes that describes the state\n\n## Attributes\n\n- Indentifier - Unique ID of each process\n- State - Current situation of the process (Either running or not running)\n- Priority - Self explanatory\n- Program Counter - Keeps information about next process to be executed\n- Memory pointers - Pointers to program code and data to be processed. Along with this, it also includes shared memory blocks.\n- Context data\n- I/O status information - Eg. List of files in use by the process etc.\n- Accounting information - Eg. Time limits, clocks used etc.\n\n> In short the attributes can be called as meta-data.\n\n## Process Control Block (PCB)\n\n- All the attributes discussed above are part of this block.\n- Basically, it is a type of data structure.\n\n> **Thus, process is a combination of program code, associated data and PCB**\n\n## Running on single resource\n\n- To manage multiple processes on a single resources then scheduling comes to the picture.\n- Thus, you allocate certain span of time to each process and once it gets finished, immediately another process starts.\n- It gives an appearance that every process runs at the same time because the total time taken by all the process combined is really small.\n- **Trace - List of instructions that are executed by a process.**\n- **Dispatcher - Program that switches the processor from one process to another.** It is a type of short term scheduler.\n\n## Execution of Processes by Processor\n\n- Suppose that there are some processes which have a lot of instructions to execute. This might take time which is greater than the allocated one.\n- So in the middle of the execution of a process, dispatcher stops the execution and decides which process should go next.\n- Once decided, either execution of new process starts or execution of old process continues.\n- Then, suppose there is an I/O request. Since this is a slow operation, the dispatcher will allow another process to run on the processor.\n- This goes on and on untill all the processes are executed.\n\n> The above method is from **processor POV** and is called **interleaving of processes** and the OS manages this through **dispatcher**. From **process POV**, the process gets executed sequencially.\n\n## Process States\n\n- Two states\n  - Running\n  - Not running\n- Transition from **not running** to **running** state is called **dispatch** and is called **pause** for the opposite scenario.\n- There can be at most only one process in running state at a given instance of time.\n- There are 'n' number of processes in the non-running state.\n- Thus, to manage all these processes, we need **queue** as the data structure.\n\n## Note\n\n- The below picture lists conditions under which a process can be created or terminated.\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-16-50.png)\n\n- Process spawning means event where a process creates a new process.\n\n## 5-State Process Model\n\n- Conditions when the process which is running will pause and enter in the queue:\n  - Time slot alloted to the process is over.\n  - Made some I/O request which may take time.\n- Now, dispatcher needs to identify which processes are ready to be executed and then dispatch it from the middle of the queue.\n- This process is time consuming and complex.\n- To resolve this, OS must maintain multiple queues. Since there are two types of processes, one who did not terminate but their allocated time got over and others who are waiting for I/O or other resouces.\n- This, in turn is the 5-state process model.\n- Total states in this model\n  - New - Process that has just been created but not admitted to the pool of the ready state processes.\n    - **Not loaded in main memory but is created.**\n    - This means that PCB for that process has been created but its corresponding data and program has not been loaded/created in the main memory.\n  - Ready\n  - Blocked/Waiting\n  - Running\n  - Exit (Earlier it was not a state but now it is) - Process which has been released from the pool of processes.\n    - However, there is some part of PCB left in main memory for accounting.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-32-07.png)\n\n## State Transitions\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-36-29.png)\n\n- Ready and Blocked process can enter directly to exit state when its parent process has terminated or the process is terminated by the OS.\n\n- When process spawning occurs, then child process is created in the new state.\n\n- Hang state is equivalent to blocked/waiting state.\n\n## Multiple Blocked Queue\n\n- Suppose there are 10 processes which are in blocked queue waiting for HDD to get accesible and there are 90 processes that are in hang mode.\n- Now once HDD is ready to be accessed, OS will have to search this blocked queue and move all these processes to ready state.\n- This is again time consuming and complex.

They are the programs that help give access to the functionalities provided by the OS.\n- They are written in a high-level language like C or C++.\n- POSIX API is used for Linux and Win32 API is used for windows.\n\n## Implementation of System Call\n\n- Associated with each function call. Eg. If you call a function printf() in C, then it internally calls an associated system call telling the OS to display the written part on the scree.\n- Every OS have a list of system call along with ID's.\n- System call interface maintains a table with ID's as indices.\n- This interface invokes a particular system call in OS kernel and returns the status and return-values if any.\n- Details are hidden from programmer by the API.\n\n## Relationship between API, System Call and OS\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-10-48-06.png)\n\n## Types of system calls\n\n- File Management - Eg. create, open, close etc.\n- Device Management - request, release, read, write etc.\n- Protection - control access, get and set permissions etc.\n- Information maintenance - get time, set process etc.\n- Communications - create, delete communication, send or recieve messages etc.\n\n### Architecture of UNIX\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-11-08-15.png)\n\n- UNIX is an OS just like Linux.\n\n- In fact linux is based on UNIX but is more complicated than UNIX.\n\n- UNIX system follows monolithic approach\n\n- UNIX System Kernel\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-11-10-53.png)\n\n- **In Linux or UNIX, everything is in terms of files.

It controls the sequence of events. Resident monitor (another name for simple monitor) is software always in memory.

Older windows versions\n  - Microkernels - Move as much functionalities as possible to user mode from kernel mode. \n    - Unlike that in layered and monolithic where majority of the functionalities is available in only kernal mode.\n    - I\\\\O and interrupt management, primitive memory management, inter-process communication and basic scheduling were kept in kernel mode.\n    - All other functionalities will be running in user mode.\n    - Advantages\n      - Time is reduced significantly as the time to change the mode from user to kernel and vice versa is almost completely diminished.\n      - Porting of OS to newer architecture becomes easier (will be covered in upcoming lectures).\n      - More reliable because less code is running in kernel mode.\n      - More secure as less code has to be valudated in kernel.\n    - Disadvantages\n      - Performance overhead to change the mode.\n    - Eg. Mach, MINIX, Windows NT Client-Server\n  - Modules - Most moedern OS implement kernel modules\n    - These are loadable kernel module\n    - Uses OOP\n    - Similar to layers but is more flexible\n    - Eg.

Ionic, Covalent and Metallic)\n- Ionic bonds are non-directional whereas covalent bonds are directional in nature. **Non-directional means that the magnitude of bond is equal in all directions around an ion.**\n- Secondary Bonding means that electrons are shared. This type of bonding is weaker compared to primary bonding. (Eg. inert gases (H2, Cl2) or permanet dipoles (H20, HCl))\n- Enet (due to all attractions and repulsions) is known as **madelung energy**.\n- The predominant bonding in **ceramic materials** is **ionic.**\n\n## Covalent Bonding\n\n- **Covalent bonding occurs between atoms with small differences in electronegativity.**\n- The stable electroninc configuration is achieved by **sharing of electrons**.\n- Generally occur between non-metals and is directional bond.\n- Number of colvalent bonds is determined by the number of valence electrons.\n- Percent of ionic characters:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-46-57.png)\n\n- Here Xa and Xb are the electronegativities of elements a and b. Greater the difference between electronegativities, greater is the ionic bonding and vice versa.\n\n## Metallic Bonding\n\n- Found in metals and their alloys.\n- According to the model presented, the valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom in the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal.\n- Thus, these are called as electron clound as the electrons are all over the metal.\n- The remaining non-valence electrons and nucleus form the ion core and **posses a net positive charge** equal to total valence electrons charge per atom.\n- The free electrons sheild the positively charged ion cores from mutually repulsive electrostatic forces along with acting as a **glue**.\n- Because of the availability of free electrons, metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity.\n\n## Van der waals bodning\n\n- All the above mentioned bonds are **primary** bonds and this type of bond is **secondary** in nature.\n- It is weaker as compared to primary bonds.\n- It is virtually ubiquitous but presence of primary bonds diminishes their effect.\n- Usually found between **inert gases**.\n- Dipoles are formed which exists whenever there is some separation of positive and negative portions of an atom or molecule.\n- Hydrogen bonding is a special type of secondary bonding that exists metweeb some molecules that have hydrogen as one of its constituents.\n\n## Summary of Bonding\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-50-27.png)\n\n","n":0.033}}},{"i":47,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lecture 1","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\n## Introduction to Material Science and Engineering\n\n## Points to Ponder\n\n- With slight change in physical properties, we can get a whole new material.

After multiple iterations a child knows that when a telephone rings, we pick it up and talk. Similar is the case with wireless mobile phones but the range is low in wired case.\n- Thus, identifying the scheme is of prime importance.

This immense heating causing chemically binded water to detach from the clay making it very hard.\n- **Note that the temperature when firing the clay should be raised slowly and not drastically.**\n- This is because clay is porous and when firing, chemically bonded water will try to escape. Now, if suddenly the temperature is raised then the chemically bonded water will not escape suddenly.\n- Instead, the silica fuses into one another trapping the chemically bonded water.\n- Now, at high temperatures, these chemically bonded water turns into steam creating air bubbles.\n- As a result, the clay will disintegrate immediately. Same applies for cooling too. You have to cool the clay very slowly.\n\n## Colors of material at different temperature\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-10.png)\n\n## Quartz Inversion Temperature\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-43.png)\n- Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2) and has a trigonal crystalline structure called as alpha-quartz.\n- At 573 degrees it gets converted into beta-quartz which is hexagonal in shape.\n- So now, it holds clay at 6 points unlike earlier where it holded clay at only 3 points.\n- Now, because of this beta-quartz, the properties of silica change and thus, becomes impervious to water damage.\n- Now, if we cool the clay as soon as it reached 573 degrees, only some part of clay will get converted and majority will disintegrate as soon as it comes in contact of water.\n- Therfore, it is of vital importance that we keep the clay at least equal to 573 degrees for about 2-3 hrs. It depends on how big is the pot.\n- Finally, after quartz inversion takes place, clay turns into ceramics.\n\n## Sintering\n\n- This is the next phase of clay firing starting at 900 degrees.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-33-49.png)\n- **After this phase, the water will be retained because of fusion of clay particles.**\n- Pores get removed due to exertion of pressure on each silica particle.\n- This process is called **solid phase sintering.**\n\n## Vitrification\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-41-09.png)\n- After solid phase sintering, there might be some pores that are still left which may allow water to pass.\n- Thus, this next phase is crucial to cover all the pores.\n- In order to lower the melting point of silica, flux is added.\n- Flux is **glassy** in nature. In fact, vitri means glass case.\n- Flux are oxides of metals like calcium, sodian, magnesium, lead, potassion, manganese etc.\n- Now, these oxides (in power form) melt at 1600 degrees and form a liquid.\n- This liquid flows into the pores and solidifies there making the clay fully impervious.\n- This process is called **liquid phase sintering.**\n- **Here, note that silica particles are not melting. It is the flux that is melting.**\n\n## Glazing\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-52-17.png)\n- It beautifies clay by giving it a feel of glass.\n- **Vitreous means glassy.**\n\n## Summary of stages of clay\n\n- Quartz inversion\n- Solid phase sintering\n- Liquid phase sintering (vitrification).\n- This turns clay to ceramics.\n- Glaze\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- Melting point of silica = 2000 degress.\n\n* * *\n\n## Wood\n\n- This is an organic material and is found in nature.\n- Made from cellulose and bio-organisms can decay these materials.\n- Carving would be easier on wood rather than that on stone because wood is way more softer than stone.\n- Wood is higly porous.\n\n## Surfaces of wood\n\n- Inlay\n  - Insertion of stone by making a fine cut in the wood.\n- Paint\n- Varnish\n- Gilded\n  - Gold leaf is applied with plaster like substance (to provide adhesiveness to gold leaf) to give wood a appearance of metal.\n- Lacquer\n  - Dip the material in lac which develop aesthetic cracks.\n\n## Important timbers\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-01.png)\n\n## Types of wood\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-47.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-11-49.png)\n\n## Components of wood\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-12-21.png)\n- If all the water is lost from the wood, then the wood would shrink and vice versa.\n- The exansion and contraction takes place in wood to a great extent. This is because wood is made of cellulose.\n- This changes the shape of wood and this process if called warping of wood.\n- Polysaccharides gives wood its woody appearance. They are just mixture of sugar.\n- Hemicellulose is branched chain and cellulose is composed of mixture of unbranched chain. Former is a mixture of sugar whereas latter is the mixture of glucose.\n- Lignin acts as a binding agent and gives wood its hardness and softness.

It is a very sharp metallic point/tool.\n  - Then, they take silver wire and hammer it in those grooves and thus this silver design is made. This is called silver inlay.\n  - Now, to smoothen the surface, it is polished. With regorous polishing, all the temporary black goes away and the entire silvery surface turns white.\n  - In final preparation, **mud of bidar** + water + dilute ammonium chloride and a dough is made and then you rub this object.\n  - By doing this, all the zinc area becomes permanent black.\n  - Silver does not become black because silver is less reactive then zinc and hence does not get converted to black color.\n  - **Silver only reacts with sulphide. This is chloride.**\n\n## Ceramics\n\n> Made of clay. It is neither metallic nor organic. Clay is the final product of weathering of rock.\n\n- Clay is basically silica and alumina. (SiO2 and Al2O3).\n- When you introduce water, clay becomes really soft and it disintegrates easily.\n- To overcome this problem, we heat the clay at very high temperature and as a result, it becomes very hard and dense.\n- So basically, on heating we are removing water and hence it looses its plasticity.\n- Terracotta army\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-02-41.png)\n  - Terra means earth\n  - Terracota is basically fired clay.\n  - Brick is made of terracota.\n- BASIC Materials\n- Stucco is made from unbaked clay or sunbaked clay.

Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.\n- Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.\n- It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.\n- Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations.

Two types include anode and cathode.\n- Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.\n- Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.\n- Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.\n- This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.\n- So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.\n- **To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.**\n- Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.\n- Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection.

This is particularly relevant in summer when daylight hours are much longer and could expose your items for far longer than is necessary\n\n### Why use daylight in museums?\n- Better Color Rendering\n- Fuller Spectrum(VIBGYOR)\n- Connection to the outside\n- Problem: - It depends on type of day. If it is a cloudy then it will be gloomy.\n- But one good thing is that it gives better colour rendering index(CRI).\n- CRI- Color Rendering Index is degree of color shift objects undergo when illuminated by the light source as compared with a color of those same objects undergo when illuminated by a reference source of comparable color temperature \n- If CRI = 100% -> See object in perfect colour\n- CRI < 70% -> See object in false colour\n- CRI(museum) = 80-100% or 90-100% -> gets true colour\n- Eg: Foundation Beyeler, Switzerland, Tate Modern, London, UK , The Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, TX\n \n\n### Conservation Considerations\n- Exposure to sunlight\n    - Generally, all direct sunlight should be avoided.\n    - Shading systems can allow diffuse light and block  all direct sunlight\n    - Image 1(High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia): Interior of gallery Image 2(The Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, Texas): Exterior of gallery(glass + UV filler)\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66742229/144404633-21db8c41-2daf-4e6f-8b3d-1996d031ca84.png)\n\n- Exposure to diffuse daylight\n- Exposure to UV\n  - Limit by using UV filters in  glazing\n  Image(The Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, Texas): Exterior of gallery(glass + UV filler)\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66742229/144405029-530ef384-5ecf-4acf-8617-89032495ca49.png)\n    \n### Eliminating non-visible radiation\n1. Ultraviolet radiation\n- Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is invisible, so it needs to be carefully monitored. \n- Given the advances in anti-UV technology, items can be affected by as little as 10 microwatts of ultraviolet per one lumen of light. Both daylight and artificial light emit UV radiation. Its short wavelength is the most damaging component of light to museum artifacts.\n- There are many tools museums can employ to combat this invisible threat, including some of the following materials:\n     - Laminated glass, self-adhesive film and other UV-absorbing materials such as varnish and acrylics for windows, skylights and display cases \n     - UV-absorbing sleeves and filters for artificial light sources \n     - Lamps and tubes with a low ultraviolet emission\n     - White paints, based on titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Light reflected by a white painted wall contains less than 20% of its original amount of UV radiation. Whitewash (chalk) is not effective\n     - Each of these materials has varying life expectancy, so keep monitoring how effective they are. Laminated glass lasts the longest, while you should check with your seller to see if their films and filters are appropriate for use museums.\n     \n2. Infrared Radiation\n- Many light sources emit infrared radiation, which we cannot see but we feel in the form of heat. Tungsten lights are famously inefficient. A 100 watt bulb could use 94% of its electricity for heat.\n- Hot display cases or rooms can cause fluctuations in relative humidity and damage collections in the process. Such radiation should, therefore, be managed and controlled efficiently.\n- Here are some tips on controlling heat from light:\n    - Mount lights at a safe distance from museum objects, preferably outside display cases.\n    - Use 'cool-beam' lamps, that reflect heat back but allow visible light through.\n    - Install fibre-optic lights, which bring light from an external heat source, thus automatically filtering out both UV and infrared radiation.\n    - Planning for infrared radiation is essential when designing a lighting system for museums and galleries. Consult professional museum designers and conservators before investing in lights. Ensure that every lighting system meets museum standards.\n\n### Artifcial Source of lighting\nRequirement of an artificial lighting is: - not generate heat and UV\n1. Incandescent light\n- An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). \n- Electric energy -> Heat -> Light energy\n- The filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or a vacuum. \n- In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal onto the filament, thereby extending its life.\n- It is very inefficient mode of lighting.\n3. Fluorescent Light\n- A fluorescent lamp, or fluorescent tube, is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp that uses fluorescence to produce visible light. \n- It is real source of UV.\n- An electric current in the gas excites mercury vapor, which produces short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor coating on the inside of the lamp to glow. \n- A fluorescent lamp converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps. \n- The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.\n**Note: You can get UV light through a filter layer of polycarbonate sheet** \n4. Fibre Optics\n- The light in a fiber-optic cable travels through the cable (hallway) by constantly bouncing from the cladding (mirror-lined walls), a principle called total internal reflection. \n- Because the cladding does not absorb any light from the core, the light wave can travel great distances.\n- When angle of refraction becomes more than critical angle then internal reflection occurs.\n- Here, UV and heat are blocked at the generator.\n5. LED\n- A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. \n- Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. So repulsion is caused.\n- The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor\n<img width=\"294\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-02 at 6 57 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66742229/144430999-96c15324-6f04-4d17-ba64-b8360b7df7c1.png\">\n\n- P-N semiconductor \n   - P-type conductor : Hole concentration conductor\n   - N-type conductor : Electron concentration conductor\n- It is a combination of a P-type semiconductor (larger hole concentration) with an N-type semiconductor (larger electron concentration). Applying a sufficient forward voltage will cause the electrons and holes to recombine at the P-N junction, releasing energy in the form of light.\n- LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) convert electrical energy directly into light, delivering efficient light generation with little-wasted electricity.","n":0.025}}},{"i":81,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lecture 20","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n ## Ways by which we can preserve the artefact\n1.

Water is flowing from interior to exterior part because of evaporation.\n        * Thus, the salt crystallizes in the exterior region of the wall.\n        * This will create expansion of the exterior layer and it will fall.\n        * **Thus, layer by layer, the external surface detaches and this is known as exfoliation.**\n\n## Leaching of marbles\n* Marble is Calcite/Carcium Carbonate (CaCO3).\n* This CaCO3 reacts with acid rain and forms calcium sulphate which is soluble.\n* Thus, it looses all the details and it is said that marble **leaches out.**\n* Acid rain means NO2 and SO2 (both present in atmosphere) dissolves in water and forms HNO3 and H2SO4.\n\n## Deterioration in ceramics\n* Ceramics are very porous in nature (except porcellian).\n* Porosity depends on heating. More heating, less porous and vice versa.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-12-04-08-41-36.png)","n":0.042}}},{"i":87,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lecture 15","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\n## Paintings (Cont.)\n\n> How to classify an oil as drying or non-drying oil?\n\n> Check for iodine number.

Hence increases the time period.\n\n- Thus, multiply the prescaler to clock time period to get the adequate delay.\n\n- Overflow flag is located on 0th bit. Hence to check overflow we check TIFR & 0x1 to be 0.\n\n- **Make sure that to reset the flag by putting \"1\" to the flag.**\n\n- The reason for this could be understood using an analogy. These are not the direct registers. These like control registers which means they act as a switch. We are pressing the \"reset\" switch (by putting \"1\") and in turn it is telling the actual register to reset the values. Thus, instead of 0, we are passing 1.\n\n- Example questions\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-40-28.png)\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-42-27.png)\n  - Toggle bits on 4th Pin of PORTB continuously with delay of 70 microseconds.

It would all be automated and done by github actions.\n* Steps\n    * Go to github actions tab on the site.\n    * Click create new workflow.\n    * Under the continuous integration workflows, click more  continuous integration workflows.\n    * Select the **Python application** and click set up this workflow.\n        * name: Self-explanatory\n        * on: when do you want to trigger the scripts\n        * push: Implies that the scripts will trigger on push\n        * branches: On which branch shall the \"event\" (push, pull etc) occur, so as to trigger CI workflow.\n        * jobs: **Most important part.**\n        * build: We specify whether we are building or deploying (write deploy instead of build to let it know that its a deploy script)\n        * runs-on: Remote desktop offered by **github.**\n        * steps: Self-explanatory\n        * uses: preferable keep it actions/checkout@v2. It implies that we are just building and not deploying. For deploying we will need to \"ssh\" into the server and hence we will need to change this.\n        * name: name of the script\n        * uses: Since, we selected python, keep it as it is.\n        * with: Specify the version, for us it would be a python version.\n        * run: Here write the script for building your project\n        ```bash\n        pip install flake8\n        pip install pytest\n        cd frontend\n        npm install\n        npm run build\n        ```\n        * The above script builds our react frontend project.\n        * flake8 is a python library to check coding styles and warnings including some imported libraries that are unused and undefined names etc.\n        * For information on pytest follow this [link](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/)\n        * Initially pytest will give an error and hence it would be better to comment it. This bug is yet to be fixed.\n        * Commit the file and your CI is ready to go!\n\n> Check for errors in the details section and resolve any that is encountered.\n\n### Continuous Deployment (CD)\n* It is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate any changes and deploys it to the server.\n* Simply put, after CI, it deploys your code to the production environment automatically.\n\n\n> There are two ways to acheive this. One, to accomodate the code in the CI.yml file itself and the other is to create a whole new file for increasing modularity.\n* We have done the second approach.\n* For the first one, copy the build code written above and instead of build (under jobs), write deploy and then write the code as per the below steps.\n\n* Steps\n    * Go to actions tab on the site.\n    * Click create new workflow.\n    * Click on **create a workflow yourself.**\n    * Most of the code remains the same as that in CI.\n    * Under jobs, replace build with deploy.\n    * Delete the **workflow_dispatch** code.\n    * Further, delete the **uses section and single command code** under **steps**.\n    * By now, you will only be left with one multi-line script under **steps**.\n    * Replace the **name** with anything relavant.\n    * Then type the following without any tabs or indentation. **Note that the following should be exactly below name and without a hypen (-)**\n        * uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master\n        * This allows github to \"ssh\" into our server.\n    * Now open a terminal in your **local machine** and type the following command.\n        * ```bash\n            ssh-keygen -C <EMAILID>\n        ```\n        * Make sure to replace <EMAILID> with radio's email ID.\n        * This will create a new public and private key.\n    * Then, go to the settings of the repository.\n    * Left hand side, click on secrets and then click on new repository secret.\n    * Provide your newly created **private key** and name it anything relevant.\n    * Now \"ssh\" into the server and under .ssh/authorized_keys, place the newly created **public key** in it.\n    * Now go back on github site and add the with section shown in the below image. Make sure it is exactly the same except changing the secrets name accoring to what you have added in github secrets.\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-18-19-36.png)\n    * **Make sure that you change the secrets with your respective server.**\n    * With the same indentation as that of host, key etc. write script for deployment.\n    * script: |\n        ```bash\n        cd stepwellradio\n        git pull https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME><REPO_NAME>.git\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install flake8 pytest\n        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\n        cd frontend\n        npm install\n        cd ..\n        cd backend\n        python manage.py collectstatic\n        echo \"Deployed Successfully\"\n        ```\n    * Once it is done, you are good to go.\n    * Check details of guthub actions to make sure that there aren't any errors during the deployment.\n    * Some potential errors\n        * python, pip, nodejs and npm not installed.\n        * So make sure that these are installed on the server.\n        * **Note that these errors are just for first time set up of the server and hence the commands that are needed to install these need not be placed under the scripts.**\n\n> There are certain errors that are yet to be resolved like deploy should happen after build returns exit code 0 and some python virtual environment related issues.\n","n":0.033}}}]}
