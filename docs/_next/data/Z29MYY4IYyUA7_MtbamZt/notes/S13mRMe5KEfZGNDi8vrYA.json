Silver is very low in quantity.</li>\n<li>First zinc and copper is melted and then the object is dipped in copper sulphate solution to obtain a blackish color.</li>\n<li>This black is temporary.</li>\n<li>Now, with metallic stylus, designs are engraved. It is a very sharp metallic point/tool.</li>\n<li>Then, they take silver wire and hammer it in those grooves and thus this silver design is made. This is called silver inlay.</li>\n<li>Now, to smoothen the surface, it is polished. With regorous polishing, all the temporary black goes away and the entire silvery surface turns white.</li>\n<li>In final preparation, <strong>mud of bidar</strong> + water + dilute ammonium chloride and a dough is made and then you rub this object.</li>\n<li>By doing this, all the zinc area becomes permanent black.</li>\n<li>Silver does not become black because silver is less reactive then zinc and hence does not get converted to black color.</li>\n<li><strong>Silver only reacts with sulphide.
