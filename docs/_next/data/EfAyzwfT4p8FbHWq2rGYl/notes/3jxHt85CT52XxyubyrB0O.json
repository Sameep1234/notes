This happens because salt ionizes very easily.</li>\n<li>Through capillary actions, salt reaches high up on the wall of the structure.</li>\n<li>The pores act as capilaries.</li>\n<li>More and more moisture on the walls, more and more salt can get accumulated.</li>\n<li>Now, when moisture escapes because of heat, salt crystallizes and this leads to expansion of the structure.</li>\n<li>Then, when moisture again comes because of humidity, it contracts.</li>\n<li>This results into development of huge cracks and gets deteriorated.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Exfoliation\n<ul>\n<li>This is a <strong>characteristic feature of sandstone</strong>.

Water is flowing from interior to exterior part because of evaporation.</li>\n<li>Thus, the salt crystallizes in the exterior region of the wall.</li>\n<li>This will create expansion of the exterior layer and it will fall.</li>\n<li><strong>Thus, layer by layer, the external surface detaches and this is known as exfoliation.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"leaching-of-marbles\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#leaching-of-marbles\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Leaching of marbles</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Marble is Calcite/Carcium Carbonate (CaCO3).</li>\n<li>This CaCO3 reacts with acid rain and forms calcium sulphate which is soluble.</li>\n<li>Thus, it looses all the details and it is said that marble <strong>leaches out.</strong></li>\n<li>Acid rain means NO2 and SO2 (both present in atmosphere) dissolves in water and forms HNO3 and H2SO4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"deterioration-in-ceramics\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#deterioration-in-ceramics\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Deterioration in ceramics</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ceramics are very porous in nature (except porcellian).</li>\n<li>Porosity depends on heating.
