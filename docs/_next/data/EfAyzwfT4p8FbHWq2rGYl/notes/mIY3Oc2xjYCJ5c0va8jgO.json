This means that chromium layer is non-porous.</li>\n<li>If there is a small scratch in steel objects, then the chromium oxide layer is ripped off and the inner (iron) metal is exposed.</li>\n<li>This is the place where you may see corrosion in steel objects.</li>\n<li>Bidriware\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-11-10-31-28.png\"></li>\n<li>Made using zinc, copper and silver.</li>\n<li>Zinc and silver provide silvery appearance and copper provides a bit of yellow appearance.</li>\n<li>This black layer appears because of alloy of zinc and copper. Silver is very low in quantity.</li>\n<li>First zinc and copper is melted and then the object is dipped in copper sulphate solution to obtain a blackish color.</li>\n<li>This black is temporary.</li>\n<li>Now, with metallic stylus, designs are engraved. It is a very sharp metallic point/tool.</li>\n<li>Then, they take silver wire and hammer it in those grooves and thus this silver design is made. This is called silver inlay.</li>\n<li>Now, to smoothen the surface, it is polished. With regorous polishing, all the temporary black goes away and the entire silvery surface turns white.</li>\n<li>In final preparation, <strong>mud of bidar</strong> + water + dilute ammonium chloride and a dough is made and then you rub this object.</li>\n<li>By doing this, all the zinc area becomes permanent black.</li>\n<li>Silver does not become black because silver is less reactive then zinc and hence does not get converted to black color.</li>\n<li><strong>Silver only reacts with sulphide. This is chloride.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ceramics\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#ceramics\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Ceramics</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Made of clay.

(SiO2 and Al2O3).</li>\n<li>When you introduce water, clay becomes really soft and it disintegrates easily.</li>\n<li>To overcome this problem, we heat the clay at very high temperature and as a result, it becomes very hard and dense.</li>\n<li>So basically, on heating we are removing water and hence it looses its plasticity.</li>\n<li>Terracotta army\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-02-41.png\"></li>\n<li>Terra means earth</li>\n<li>Terracota is basically fired clay.</li>\n<li>Brick is made of terracota.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>BASIC Materials</li>\n<li>Stucco is made from unbaked clay or sunbaked clay.
