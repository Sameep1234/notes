Thus, we can say that the non-metallic quality of metal increases.</li>\n<li><strong>Magnetic effect</strong> is used to detect how much <strong>core metal</strong> is left and how much <strong>rust</strong> is formed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"electrochemical-series\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#electrochemical-series\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Electrochemical Series</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-24-30.png\"></li>\n<li>The metals here are placed according to their decreasing reactivity. Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.</li>\n<li>Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.</li>\n<li>It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.</li>\n<li>Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations. Another reason for that use is that it is an excellent conductor of electrivity.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-29-17.png\"></li>\n<li>Oxidation \n<ul>\n<li>When a metal looses electron. </li>\n<li>The power to loose electron is called oxidation potential.</li>\n<li>Lesser reactive metals have lower oxidation potential than more reactive metals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reduction\n<ul>\n<li>When a metal gains electron.</li>\n<li>The power to gain electron is called reduction potential.</li>\n<li>Lesser reactive metals have higher reduction potential than more reactive metals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reducing agent is a more reactive metal that displaces a metal from its sulfate state and vice versa.</li>\n<li>In metallic terms, oxidation is also called corrosion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"galvanic-cell\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#galvanic-cell\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Galvanic Cell</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Also known as Voltaic cell or Daniel cell or Electrochemical cell</li>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-39-33.png\"></li>\n<li>Electrode is a solid electrical conductor that carries a current. Two types include anode and cathode.</li>\n<li>Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.</li>\n<li>Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.</li>\n<li>Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.</li>\n<li>This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.</li>\n<li>So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.</li>\n<li><strong>To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.</strong></li>\n<li>Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.</li>\n<li>Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection.
