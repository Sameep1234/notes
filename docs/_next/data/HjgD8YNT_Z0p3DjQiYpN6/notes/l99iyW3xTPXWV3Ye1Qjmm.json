After multiple iterations a child knows that when a telephone rings, we pick it up and talk. Similar is the case with wireless mobile phones but the range is low in wired case.</li>\n<li>Thus, identifying the scheme is of prime importance. So, for the telephone example, the scheme is that whenever it rings, someone comes and picks it up.</li>\n<li>Now, the new experience is of mobile phones. What to do when it rings? This has to be incorported by the child.</li>\n<li>Operations\n<ul>\n<li>Those actions that can be reversed or they are called reversible actions.</li>\n<li>Types of operations\n<ul>\n<li>Cause and effect - Eg. Switch</li>\n<li>Conservation of substance - Eg. Clay</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Four stages\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sensorimotor stage</strong> (birth to 2 yrs) \n<ul>\n<li>Focus on present object and not on the object that is not there.</li>\n<li>They have basic schmes of shaking, twisting, pushing etc. (inbuilt)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Preoperational stage</strong> (2 to 7 years)\n<ul>\n<li>Think about the objects that are not present.</li>\n<li>Don't think of reversible consequence of actions.</li>\n<li>Use perception rather than logic.</li>\n<li>Eg. Water in different shapes of container.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Concrete-Operational stage</strong> (7 to 11 yrs)\n<ul>\n<li>These are tied to their actual experiences.</li>\n<li>Eg. Water in bottle to glass</li>\n<li><strong>They are not able to generalise the results to all the types of substances.</strong></li>\n<li>They are not able to think in hypothetical situations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Formal-Operational stage</strong> (11 to 16 yrs)\n<ul>\n<li>Notice similarites between operations performed on different objects.</li>\n<li><strong>They are able to generalise the results obtained in one situations to other situations.</strong></li>\n<li>They can now think in hypothetical world.</li>\n<li>Eg. How much air does a room contain? It is the volume of the room.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"vigotskys-theory\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#vigotskys-theory\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Vigotsky's Theory</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Its main principle is that children develop in the social world by interacting with other people and products of their cultural history.</li>\n<li>Eg. Child born in a tribe and in a modern family.\n<ul>\n<li>The difference between learning language in modern family and that in tribe would be of written documentation.</li>\n<li>Tribe people might not have a written manuscript of the symbols and language that they use whereas modern family have perfectly well maintained documentation of the rules and regulations of their language.</li>\n<li>Thus, a child in tribe might learn about only the spoken part and not the written part whearas in modern family, a child learns both.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social elements\n<ul>\n<li>Symbols</li>\n<li>Knowledge</li>\n<li>Ideas</li>\n<li>Mode of reasoning</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"difference-in-perspective-of-both-theories\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#difference-in-perspective-of-both-theories\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Difference in perspective of both theories</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-12-11-44-22.png\"></li>\n<li>In the above example, from piaget's perspective, the child discovered the rule of commutativity because the child acted on the pebbles (physical environment) and while playing with it.</li>\n<li>From the vigotsky's perspective, the child belongs to the community where they know how to count or at least that community value counting because of which the child started counting.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the child could have done numerous other activities with the pebbles like throwing it, catching it etc.</li>\n<li>This also means that the community also has some symbols that facilitate counting. Otherwise, how will a child count?</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"GL4YoVrbDUHLnf946YtXV","title":"Curated Notes","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{},"fname":"root","updated":1630150480330,"created":1629975412335,"parent":null,"children":["Jq5ki9jf1QLTdc3DYLRW4","3ONxZ3Khb7nFPdLxlV1ib","Z2JlSyF7TPv3hFanVQhJd"],"body":"\n\r\n\r\nYou have reached the home page of my curated notes.
