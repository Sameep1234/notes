They go hand in hand.</li>\n<li>Functionalist study mental feats like learning, memory and problem solving.</li>\n<li>Issue\n<ul>\n<li>No scientific method to determine the role of mind (Consciousness of mind).</li>\n<li>Can't be called scientific because it can't be generalised. It varies from individual to individual.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, it is not observed and experiemented and hence it is other reason for it not being scientific.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"behaviourlism\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#behaviourlism\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Behaviourlism</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Not focus on mind, see only the behaviour i.e the observable actions.</li>\n<li>We can't see what's on the mind, behaviour is the only thing that can be observed.</li>\n<li>Eg. Dog video with bell and food. Dog associates whenever bell is rung, food will come and hence dog starts salivating on seeing bell even when there was no food around.</li>\n<li>Three characteristics to keep in mind\n<ul>\n<li>Complex behaviour comes from elementary behaviour that we have learnt from the birth.</li>\n<li>Focus only on learned behaviour.

We should also be ready to seek feedback. Furthermore other members should not feel that they are being judged.</li>\n<li>To reduce the fourth quadrant, we need to have as many diverse experiences as possible at individual level. At manager level, we can conduct various kinds of interesting activiteis where other members open up. We must provide new opportunities for others to gain diverse experiences.</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"GL4YoVrbDUHLnf946YtXV","title":"Curated Notes","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{},"fname":"root","updated":1630150480330,"created":1629975412335,"parent":null,"children":["Jq5ki9jf1QLTdc3DYLRW4","3ONxZ3Khb7nFPdLxlV1ib","Z2JlSyF7TPv3hFanVQhJd"],"data":{},"contentHash":"e9b530a3175371dde392f83db6e59628","custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"\n\r\n\r\nYou have reached the home page of my curated notes.
