This immense heating causing chemically binded water to detach from the clay making it very hard.</li>\n<li><strong>Note that the temperature when firing the clay should be raised slowly and not drastically.</strong></li>\n<li>This is because clay is porous and when firing, chemically bonded water will try to escape. Now, if suddenly the temperature is raised then the chemically bonded water will not escape suddenly.</li>\n<li>Instead, the silica fuses into one another trapping the chemically bonded water.</li>\n<li>Now, at high temperatures, these chemically bonded water turns into steam creating air bubbles.</li>\n<li>As a result, the clay will disintegrate immediately. Same applies for cooling too. You have to cool the clay very slowly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"colors-of-material-at-different-temperature\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#colors-of-material-at-different-temperature\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Colors of material at different temperature</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-10.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"quartz-inversion-temperature\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#quartz-inversion-temperature\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Quartz Inversion Temperature</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-43.png\"></li>\n<li>Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2) and has a trigonal crystalline structure called as alpha-quartz.</li>\n<li>At 573 degrees it gets converted into beta-quartz which is hexagonal in shape.</li>\n<li>So now, it holds clay at 6 points unlike earlier where it holded clay at only 3 points.</li>\n<li>Now, because of this beta-quartz, the properties of silica change and thus, becomes impervious to water damage.</li>\n<li>Now, if we cool the clay as soon as it reached 573 degrees, only some part of clay will get converted and majority will disintegrate as soon as it comes in contact of water.</li>\n<li>Therfore, it is of vital importance that we keep the clay at least equal to 573 degrees for about 2-3 hrs. It depends on how big is the pot.</li>\n<li>Finally, after quartz inversion takes place, clay turns into ceramics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"sintering\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#sintering\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Sintering</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the next phase of clay firing starting at 900 degrees.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-33-49.png\"></li>\n<li><strong>After this phase, the water will be retained because of fusion of clay particles.</strong></li>\n<li>Pores get removed due to exertion of pressure on each silica particle.</li>\n<li>This process is called <strong>solid phase sintering.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"vitrification\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#vitrification\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Vitrification</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"/notes/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-41-09.png\"></li>\n<li>After solid phase sintering, there might be some pores that are still left which may allow water to pass.</li>\n<li>Thus, this next phase is crucial to cover all the pores.</li>\n<li>In order to lower the melting point of silica, flux is added.</li>\n<li>Flux is <strong>glassy</strong> in nature.
