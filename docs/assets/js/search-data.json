To acheive the same, we need to attach the strain guage in such a fashion that the value of R3 decreases.\n- Only if R3 decreases will the drop increase.\n- Now to further increase the sensitivity, we use strain guage in place of R1 and R2 also.\n- The manner of attaching the strain guage gets reversed because we want to decrease the value of R1 to increase the value of potential drop.\n- Types of bridges\n  - Quater - Only one strain guage is used.\n  - Half - Two strain guages are used.\n  - Full - Four starain guages are used.\n- Note that we should use the same/identical strain guages for (R4, R3) pair and (R1, R2) because the strain resistance is a function of temperature also and we want the conditions to be almost similar for both the strain guages.\n- This is also the reason as to why three strain guages are not used in a bridge. (This is because we want to acheive temperature independence).\n- It is obvious that full bridge is the best in terms of sensitivity but it is costlier than others.\n\n## Quater Bridge Configuration\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-30-21.png)\n\n## Half Bridge Configuration\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-32-36.png)\n\n## Full Bridge Configuration\n\n- Bending Strain\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-34-20.png)\n- Axial Strain\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-35-18.png)\n\n## Force Sensing Resistance\n\n- Conducting foam is pressed and the contact resitance will decrease.\n- This is the method by which we define a relationship with force and resistance.\n- Types\n  - Shunt Mode Force Sensitive Resistor\n    - Foam is only on one side.\n  - Thru Mode force sensitve resistor\n    - Froam is on both the sides.\n\n## Force vs Voltage\n\n- We are benefitted if the change in resistance is somehow reflected by the change in voltage.\n- To achieve this, we use the below given circuit.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-45-49.png)\n- Make sure to select R1 as 1k unless specified otherwise.\n\n## Force Alarm\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-47-54.png)\n- Vref depends on problem and hence it is not fix that the value of Vref must be 4V.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/vX8jj4V3lhESvZWrFT7IE.html","relUrl":"notes/vX8jj4V3lhESvZWrFT7IE.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 7","title":"Lecture 7","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 7","content":"## Stress and strain\n\n## Hook's Law\n\n- Amount of deformation is proportional to the force applies to any object.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-09-41-24.png)\n- F = k\\*(Change in length)\n- **Note that the force should be small for the relationship to be linear.**\n- If force greater than the threshold is applied than the relationship is not linear.\n- Elstic region corresponds to the range of force where the object will retain its shape.\n\n## Axial vs Transverse force\n\n- This is called tensile force.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-09-45-18.png)\n- Transverse strain means along the length of the object at perpendicular angle.\n\n## Compressive Force\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-09-48-42.png)\n- $\\\\frac{F}{A}$ is called stress or pressure.\n- Units of young's modulus is same as stress or pressure i.e N/m\\*2 or Pascal (Pa).\n\n## Strain Gauge\n\n- Sensor for measuring strain\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-07-40.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-10-23.png)\n- Now to calculate change in resistance, we measure the change in current or change in voltage and indirectly find change in resistance.\n- $\\\\frac{Change in R}{R}$ is very small and adding \"1\" might just lead to nothing.\n- To avoid this, we need to set a circuit such that the voltage across the resistor is linearly proportional to $\\\\frac{Change in R}{R}$.\n- We need a wheatstone bridge to get the linear proportionality.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-16-43.png)\n- **Understand the equation formed.**\n- Bridge circuit for strain measurment\n  - In the above figure, R4 is the strain gauge whereas others are normal resistors which are all equal.\n  - In bending strain or a tensile strain, the formula still remains the same becuase in either of the cases, the length of the resistor in the strain gauge will change and hence, resitance will change.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-22-11.png)\n  - Final Equation\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-24-07.png)\n  - **Note that the strain will always be positive.** According to the equation the negative value might change as change in voltage (Vo) might be negative if R4 gets too high.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/NGkq3I0wJtlVzqLTf5nTp.html","relUrl":"notes/NGkq3I0wJtlVzqLTf5nTp.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 6","title":"Lecture 6","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 6","content":"\n## Feedback control\n* Here we are considering the example of an engine of the car.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-03-09-49-46.png)\n* Motor is used for getting a particular position and not a particular speed.\n* Particular position will ensure that the desired speed is achieved.\n\n## Pulse Width modulation\n* Width of the pulse determines the average voltage.

Timer)\n  - Plant (Eg. Heating coil)\n- Type of control system\n  - Open Loop: Control action is independent of the control variable.\n    - We must assume the timer setting to be correct.\n    - Block Diagram\n      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-09-13.png)\n  - Closed Loop: Control action is dependent of the control variable.\n    - User will have manual control.\n    - Feedback recieved with the help of human senses. Can also be used as feedback in automatic control systems. For this, the feedback has to be electrical.\n    - This means that the control action depends on the output variable.\n  - There are various other factors which can't be known and hence are assumed to be constant. For example, ageing and changes in load weight. \n  - The main difference between open loop and close loop system is of feedback which is not present in open loop system.\n\n## Steady state calculation\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-20-17.png)\n\n- A is the gain of the amplifier. It is dimensionless. Also called as the loop gain.\n- Km is the motor constant. Upto Km, we will get the **speed** of the motor.\n- Ks is the sensor constant. Speed sensors input is speed and output is voltage. Dimension of Ks is opposite tso that of Km. Ks = $\\\\frac{Vf}{N}$.\n- N = speed in rpm.\n- A_Km_Ks is called the loop gain of the system. So larger its value, the smaller is the difference and hence we get almost equal value to Vs.\n- So it is better to obtain loop gain of 100 and it is achievable.\n\n## Specification of control systems\n\n- Accuracy of output in steady state.\n- Speed of response.\n- Feedback (Improves both).\n  - Because of this, the effective time constant is reduced and hence speed and accuracy is improved.\n\n## Steps in analysis of control system\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-49-06.png)\n\n## Example of Oven\n\n- Block Diagram\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-39-38.png)\n- The rate of increase depends on thermal resistance and thermal capacitance.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-42-28.png)\n- Heat flow is in watts. Theta is in degrees and thus thermal resistance is in degrees per watts.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-45-07.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-45-30.png)\n- Mathematical model of oven\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-46-21.png)\n- **For steady state**\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-47-40.png)\n  - 'q' is the coil wattage of the oven.\n- Electrical Equivalent\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-50-15.png)\n  - Note that the electrical equations are just the analogous equations.\n\n## Set Point and Closed system equivalent\n\n- The temperature reached in steady state is called set point.\n- For oven, it is qR.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-53-10.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-53-30.png)\n- Left hand side part is the steady state voltage and as evident from the figure it has some error.\n- However, if Kp is chosen to be very large as compared to 1, this error is highly reduced.\n- The coefficient of $\\\\frac{dVo}{dt}$ is time constant and here in our case it is $\\\\frac{RC}{Kp + 1}$.\n- Thus, on increasing Kp, time constant is reduced and a faster response is obtained.\n\n## Loading effect in Open Loop System\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-57-54.png)\n- **Note that the steady state voltage is reduced by half and this is a significant drop.**\n\n## Loaded system with feedback\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-58-56.png)\n- Slight difference is there in the denominator.\n\n## LTspice simulation\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-15-01-58.png)\n- Watch [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aeTFcX9shA_R6Owlvv1iaxCVnFcwAAQ/view) for better understanding (1:11:00)\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/zomvqjqWRKARLIeVDDxkO.html","relUrl":"notes/zomvqjqWRKARLIeVDDxkO.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 4","title":"Lecture 4","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 4","content":"## TinkerCAD\n\n> This lecture included the demo of TinkerCAD and hence there are not much notes of it.\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- [Arduino Code Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)\n- Digital Read Function\n  - Pin from which digital input is read.\n  - Syntax: x = digitalRead(Inpin);\n- Analog Read\n  - Syntax: x = analogread(potPin);\n  - x ranges between 0 to 1023.\n- Serial Communication\n  - Syntax = Serial.begin(9600)\n  - This has to be used in setup part of the program structure.\n  - Will establish serial communication between computer monitor and Arduino.\n  - Syntax: Serial.println(\"ADC Output\");\n  - This will print it as a string on the monitor.\n- Digital to Analog Conversion calculation\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-01-23-10-27.png)\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/vleZHXG8bEI51ctEBzzhC.html","relUrl":"notes/vleZHXG8bEI51ctEBzzhC.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 3","title":"Lecture 3","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 3","content":"## Best Fit, Measurement and Control Systems\n\n## Points\n\n- With one value of x, take many values of y and then take the average\n- Error can occur at input as well as output side\n\n## Standard Error and Standard Deviation\n\n> Measures how much discrepancy (difference) is likely to be in the sample mean and the population mean.\n\n- Std Dev = Spread of data around the mean\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-27-09-42-54.png)\n\n- In excel, multiply by sqrt(nx) and divide by sqrt(nx-1) to get the correct result\n  ![](/assets/images/2021-08-27-09-44-23.png)\n\n## Precision\n\n> Degree of reproducibility of a measurement\n\n- Accuracy and precision are different. **Outputs** for calculation is close enough then your calculation is precise but accuracy depends on the whether the output values are close to the actual value means it is accurate.\n- It is also possible that the output is more accurate and less precise and vice versa.\n  ![](/assets/images/2021-08-31-23-19-59.png)\n\n## Resolution\n\n> Smallest measurable increment\n\n- Eg.

This is called monopolizing the processor.\n\n## CPU Bound and I/O Bound\n\n- If a process spends most of its time in processor, then it is called CPU bound and vice versa.\n- Example of I/O bound process includes chatting. It uses I/O for most of the time because it is waiting for the user to enter the values.\n\n## First Come First Serve (FCFS)\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-08-14-00.png)\n- It is one of the most fair strategy in the **real world.**\n- w = waiting time.\n- For better efficiency TAT should be as low as possible.\n- Example\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-10-54-38.png)\n- Issues\n  - A short process may have to wait a very long time before it can execute.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-08-33-39.png)\n\n## Round Robin (RR)\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-12-18-13.png)\n- It is a type of **preemptive** FCFS.\n- Simple explanation\n  - There will be a queue.\n  - The process will run for some time.\n  - If the process is not completed, that process is blocked and put into ready queue.\n  - The next process runs.\n- Time given to each and every process is called time slice or **time quantum.**. It is represented by \"q\".\n- Example\n  - For the below example, the time quantum is 4. Thus, if a process is not finished after 4 units of time, it will be placed at last in the ready queue.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-12-26-01.png)\n  - Now we have the same example but with q = 1.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-12-40-19.png)\n  - Note here that the Mean NTAT for q = 4 is better than that when q = 1.\n  - Depending on the implementation of OS, these can be either pre defined or may be changed during the execution.\n- Issues\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-12-44-01.png)\n- Thus, the ideal value of time quantum is slightly greater than the time required for a typical process interaction.\n- Relative Treatment\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-13-24-26.png)\n\n## Virtual Round Robin\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-13-26-40.png)\n- In this strategy, we are assigning priority to I/O blocked processes by maintaining different queues.\n\n## Shortest Process Next (SPN)\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-15-00-03.png)\n- Example\n  - In the below example, the time shown is wrong and do your own calculation.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-15-03-17.png)\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-15-03-30.png)\n- Issues\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-15-03-48.png)\n  - Having knowledge of service time is one of the biggest overhead in **all the algorithms seen till now.**\n  - For interactive process, it is the most difficult job because the value can never be known.\n  - This is because, the process will have to wait for either I/O or for any user input.\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- DMA - Data memory access (DMA) is a hardware circuit through which all the data is transfered after an I/O is available.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/SpXfiUCnyMAY7br21tDwo.html","relUrl":"notes/SpXfiUCnyMAY7br21tDwo.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 7","title":"Lecture 7","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System.Lecture 7","content":"## Process/Processor Scheduling\n\n> Note that we have assumed uniprocessor system and hence we will be studying uniprocessor scheduling\n\n## Sceduling\n\n- OS handles resources and hence called as resource manager.\n\n- Processor provides resources in terms of its execution time.\n  > Aim: Assign processes to be executed by processor over time, in a way that meets system objectives.\n\n- Response time means the time elapsed between process creation and the **first response** from that process.\n\n- Throughput means rate of job completion.

User-Satisfaction\n- Interdependency in criterias\n  - User oriented and performance related.\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-10-29-24.png)\n    - Turnaround time is approriate for batch jobs and not for interactive jobs because in interative jobs, user interaction plays a key role. \n    - For example, a process is waiting for a user input and the user has gone to take a break, then it will remain stagnant and hence turnaround time will increase drastically.\n    - The deadlines are in real-time systems or embedded systems.\n  - User oriented and non-performance related\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-10-39-44.png)\n  - System-oriented and performance related\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-10-40-58.png)\n  - System-oriented and non-performance related\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-10-43-31.png)\n    - In the third criteria, we require medium-term and long-term scheduling because memory is one of the resource that is used by the process and processor.\n\n## Priority based scheduling\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-10-45-56.png)\n- Each ready queue has different priority, but processes inside the **same ready queue, have the same priority.**\n\n> Now this may lead to starvation problem. Suppose, there are 3 ready queues and at any particular instance of time, there is at least one process in the first two ready queues. This means that the processes in the third queue will not be allocated any time. This is the starvation problem. \n\n> To solve this, we allow a process to change its priority-based on its age or execution history. This means that whenever some process has been executed for some time and is to be again inserted in the ready queues, its priority should be lowered down.\n\n## Various Scheduling Policies\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-10-55-01.png)\n- Out of all these, round robin and feedback are the most practical theories.\n- Others are good in theory, but not in practice.\n\n## Selection Function\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-10-56-15.png)\n\n## Decision Mode\n\n- Specifies the instance in time at which the selection function is executed.\n- Two categories\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-11-00-20.png)\n  - For non-preemptive, the OS will never put a process in blocked/removed state unless it is fully terminated or blocked because of I/O.\n  - Round robin is a strategy where every process is assigned some amount of time and even if process is still able to run, it is not blocked, it is put back directly into Ready state and the next process is dispactched to running state.\n\n> Which mode should be preffered?\n>\n> - Preemptive as it prevents one process from **monopolizing** the processor.\n> - This means that a very big process will not block others till it iterminates.\n> - Even though there would be some overhead of frequent switching of the process, but its advantage outweighs its disadvantage.\n\n## Process States for Linux\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-13-24-18.png)\n- Commands related to processes in ubuntu\n  - lscpu = Gives information regarding the processor in your system.\n  - ps -aux = Gives information about the processes that are currently there in the system.\n  - Note: ps itself is the command but it won't provide much information as ps -aux.\n- System calls\n  - fork() = Create a new process\n  - exec() = Execute other programs in current process\n  - wait() = Wait for child process to terminate\n  - exit() = Terminate the execution\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/javcf3PHyxIZemUP0ry6l.html","relUrl":"notes/javcf3PHyxIZemUP0ry6l.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 6","title":"Lecture 6","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System.Lecture 6","content":"## Process Control and Process Management\n\n> Process management will be studied in UNIX SVR4 file system.\n\n## Functions of OS kernel\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-10-29.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-13-17.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-13-59.png)\n\n## Process Creation\n\n- Once new process is decided to be created, OS performs following tasks\n  - Assigning unique ID.\n  - Allocating space in memory.\n  - Initializing PCB (The most important part of a process).\n  - Setting up of appropriate links.\n  - Creating or expanding other data structures.\n\n## Process Switching\n\n- For small amount of time, some process will run and then other will run. This time is very small and hence we see it like all the processes are running parallely.\n- Thus, when one process goes away and other process needs to be loaded, this is called process switching.\n- Process switching is totally different than mode switching. In a process execution, there may occur mode switching. \n- Mode switching means switching from user to kernal mode vice versa.\n\n> So why is process gets switched?\n>\n> - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-23-14.png)\n\n- Reasons for switching (Eg.)\n  - Clock interrupt (time slice expired)\n  - I/O Interrupt (an event occured)\n  - Memory fault (trap) - Accessing memory which is not available.\n\n- Mode Switching - When a running process changes its mode from one to other.\n  - While switching the mode, processor state information of PCB is saved (user to kernel) and restored back (kernel to user).\n  - Mode switch, thus becomes the subset of prcess switch.\n  - Thus, process switch will take more time then mode switch.\n\n- Steps in process switch\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-28-44.png)\n\n> Is OS a process?\n>\n> - Basically OS is a code/program which is in between hardware and application that we run.\n> - Designs of OS to explain execution of OS\n>   - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-33-06.png)\n\n## Different designs\n\n- Non-process Kernel\n- Execution within User Processes\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-36-42.png)\n- Process-based OS\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-37-48.png)\n  - More like microkernel architecture.\n\n## Process management in UNIX SVR4\n\n- SVR4 stands for System V Release 4.\n- **Most** of the the OS executes in user process.\n- System processes - Kernel mode only\n- User Processes\n  - User mode to execute user programs and utilities.\n  - Kernel mode to execture instructions that belong to kernel\n- Process with ID 1 = Linux boots and creates a swapper process which in turn creates init process with ID = 1.\n- This init process creates all the process required to run Linux on boot up.\n- init process works only in kernel mode.\n- Some other process that execute only in kernel mode include dispatcher etc.\n- States\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-47-29.png)\n  - Fork is the system call used to create new process.\n  - Two extra states\n  - Blocking state is called sleep state.\n  - Zombie state means that process is executed but some imformation realted to data structure and all is still saved for accounting purposes.\n  - Here running state is divided into two parts viz user running state and kernel running state.\n  - At a time, a process can be in either user running state or kernel running state but **not both.**\n  - Preempted is almost similar to ready to run in memory state. In fact they are managed by a common combined queue.\n- UNIX Process Image\n  - A process in UNIX is a set of DS that provide the OS with all the information necessary to manage and dispatch processes.\n  - Process image in UNIX can be categorized as follows\n    - User-Level Context\n      - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-11-14-50.png)\n    - Register Context\n      - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-11-15-08.png)\n    - System-Level Context\n      - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-11-15-54.png)\n      - Most of the information regarding PCB is maintained in process table and they **must be accessible to kernel.**\n      - U Area - Most of the process control information is present in U area. This is also a part of PCB. However, majority of information related to PCB is present in Process table.\n      - Information in U area is accessible to a process only if it is in running state.\n      - 1st and 3rd are static DS means they will not change during the life of a process.\n      - 2nd and 4th are dynamic data structure and will change according to various states of the process.\n- Process Creation in UNIX\n  - fork() is used to create new processes.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-11-26-30.png)\n    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-11-27-38.png)\n  - If returned value is 0, it means it is child process and vice versa.\n  - Once child is created, then it depends on the situation which one will execute.\n          \n\n## Extra Points\n\n> What is in process table?\n>\n> - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-11-22-44.png)\n\n> What is in U area?\n>\n> - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-11-23-18.png)\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/0LtDXV0XLrMYsvBcbUlnw.html","relUrl":"notes/0LtDXV0XLrMYsvBcbUlnw.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 5","title":"Lecture 5","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System.Lecture 5","content":"\n## Suspended Process\n* It is possible that at one point all the processes are waiting for I/O and processor will remain idle.\n* Issues to address\n    * Processor could be idle most of the time.\n* Solution\n    * **Swap these processes to disk to free RAM and execute some new processes**.\n* Blocked state, thus, becomes suspend state when swapped to disk.\n* Now 5-state gets converted to 6-state model\n\n## 6-state model\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-01-08-08-39.png)\n* Notice that blocked processes are transferred to suspended processes but suspened processes are directly transfered to ready state.\n* OS now has two ways\n    * Admit new processes\n    * Activate previously suspended processes\n* Subsets of suspend state\n    * Blocked/Suspend: Process in secondary memory and awaiting an event.\n    * Ready/Suspend: \n\n## 7-state model\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-01-08-13-46.png)\n* Newly created process will remain in ready/suspend state until there is memory avaible to move it to ready state.\n* Eg.

Here we assume that there is always a single processor system.\n- Allocate resources to processes and protect them from each other.\n- Enable process to share and exchange information. Eg. Parent and Child processes.\n- Enable synchronization among processes.\n\n## Process\n\n- Program in execution.\n- Instance of program running\n- Entity that can be assigned to and executed on a processor\n- **Unit of activity defined by program, its states and its associated resources.**\n- Process Elements\n  - Program code (generally shared)\n  - Set of data\n  - Attributes that describes the state\n\n## Attributes\n\n- Indentifier - Unique ID of each process\n- State - Current situation of the process (Either running or not running)\n- Priority - Self explanatory\n- Program Counter - Keeps information about next process to be executed\n- Memory pointers - Pointers to program code and data to be processed. Along with this, it also includes shared memory blocks.\n- Context data\n- I/O status information - Eg. List of files in use by the process etc.\n- Accounting information - Eg. Time limits, clocks used etc.\n\n> In short the attributes can be called as meta-data.\n\n## Process Control Block (PCB)\n\n- All the attributes discussed above are part of this block.\n- Basically, it is a type of data structure.\n\n> **Thus, process is a combination of program code, associated data and PCB**\n\n## Running on single resource\n\n- To manage multiple processes on a single resources then scheduling comes to the picture.\n- Thus, you allocate certain span of time to each process and once it gets finished, immediately another process starts.\n- It gives an appearance that every process runs at the same time because the total time taken by all the process combined is really small.\n- **Trace - List of instructions that are executed by a process.**\n- **Dispatcher - Program that switches the processor from one process to another.** It is a type of short term scheduler.\n\n## Execution of Processes by Processor\n\n- Suppose that there are some processes which have a lot of instructions to execute. This might take time which is greater than the allocated one.\n- So in the middle of the execution of a process, dispatcher stops the execution and decides which process should go next.\n- Once decided, either execution of new process starts or execution of old process continues.\n- Then, suppose there is an I/O request. Since this is a slow operation, the dispatcher will allow another process to run on the processor.\n- This goes on and on untill all the processes are executed.\n\n> The above method is from **processor POV** and is called **interleaving of processes** and the OS manages this through **dispatcher**. From **process POV**, the process gets executed sequencially.\n\n## Process States\n\n- Two states\n  - Running\n  - Not running\n- Transition from **not running** to **running** state is called **dispatch** and is called **pause** for the opposite scenario.\n- There can be at most only one process in running state at a given instance of time.\n- There are 'n' number of processes in the non-running state.\n- Thus, to manage all these processes, we need **queue** as the data structure.\n\n## Note\n\n- The below picture lists conditions under which a process can be created or terminated.\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-16-50.png)\n\n- Process spawning means event where a process creates a new process.\n\n## 5-State Process Model\n\n- Conditions when the process which is running will pause and enter in the queue:\n  - Time slot alloted to the process is over.\n  - Made some I/O request which may take time.\n- Now, dispatcher needs to identify which processes are ready to be executed and then dispatch it from the middle of the queue.\n- This process is time consuming and complex.\n- To resolve this, OS must maintain multiple queues. Since there are two types of processes, one who did not terminate but their allocated time got over and others who are waiting for I/O or other resouces.\n- This, in turn is the 5-state process model.\n- Total states in this model\n  - New - Process that has just been created but not admitted to the pool of the ready state processes.\n    - **Not loaded in main memory but is created.**\n    - This means that PCB for that process has been created but its corresponding data and program has not been loaded/created in the main memory.\n  - Ready\n  - Blocked/Waiting\n  - Running\n  - Exit (Earlier it was not a state but now it is) - Process which has been released from the pool of processes.\n    - However, there is some part of PCB left in main memory for accounting.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-32-07.png)\n\n## State Transitions\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-36-29.png)\n\n- Ready and Blocked process can enter directly to exit state when its parent process has terminated or the process is terminated by the OS.\n\n- When process spawning occurs, then child process is created in the new state.\n\n- Hang state is equivalent to blocked/waiting state.\n\n## Multiple Blocked Queue\n\n- Suppose there are 10 processes which are in blocked queue waiting for HDD to get accesible and there are 90 processes that are in hang mode.\n- Now once HDD is ready to be accessed, OS will have to search this blocked queue and move all these processes to ready state.\n- This is again time consuming and complex. Hence multiple blocked queue model emerged.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-48-46.png)\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/NhWKT5qXL21FvxgJ5gQ8d.html","relUrl":"notes/NhWKT5qXL21FvxgJ5gQ8d.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 3","title":"Lecture 3","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System.Lecture 3","content":"## System Calls and Architecture of UNIX\n\n## Intro to system calls\n\n- System calls are the most important and crucial concept in OS. It is basically a link connecting user to the OS.\n- Formally, it is a **programming interface (like waiter connecting customers to kitchen in a restaurant)** to use the services provided by the OS. They are the programs that help give access to the functionalities provided by the OS.\n- They are written in a high-level language like C or C++.\n- POSIX API is used for Linux and Win32 API is used for windows.\n\n## Implementation of System Call\n\n- Associated with each function call. Eg. If you call a function printf() in C, then it internally calls an associated system call telling the OS to display the written part on the scree.\n- Every OS have a list of system call along with ID's.\n- System call interface maintains a table with ID's as indices.\n- This interface invokes a particular system call in OS kernel and returns the status and return-values if any.\n- Details are hidden from programmer by the API.\n\n## Relationship between API, System Call and OS\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-10-48-06.png)\n\n## Types of system calls\n\n- File Management - Eg. create, open, close etc.\n- Device Management - request, release, read, write etc.\n- Protection - control access, get and set permissions etc.\n- Information maintenance - get time, set process etc.\n- Communications - create, delete communication, send or recieve messages etc.\n\n### Architecture of UNIX\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-11-08-15.png)\n\n- UNIX is an OS just like Linux.\n\n- In fact linux is based on UNIX but is more complicated than UNIX.\n\n- UNIX system follows monolithic approach\n\n- UNIX System Kernel\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-11-10-53.png)\n\n- **In Linux or UNIX, everything is in terms of files.

It controls the sequence of events. Resident monitor (another name for simple monitor) is software always in memory. It reads in job and gives control to the processor which in turn returns the control back to monitor\n\n> Processor executes instructions from the memory i.e monitor which resides in the memory. It gains control from monitor to execute the task and once completed returns the control to monitor.\n\n> JCL (Job control language) - It is a programming language that provides instruction to the monitor about the compiler and data to be used.\n\n- Modes of operation\n  - User mode (Analogy: Normal Mode) - Programs submitted by the user to the memory are executed in this mode. **Not all instructions may be executed.**\n  - Kernal mode (Analogy: Admin Mode) - Part of a modern OS that actually performs I/O Management, Process Management etc. Nowadays, we have many other utility programs running which are a part of OS, but kernal is the most important one which manages the above mentioned things.\n\n- Issues\n  - Processor remains idle.\n  - Slow compared to processor even with automatic job sequence.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-23-38-27.png)\n\n## Uniprogramming\n\n> Processor must wait for I/O instruction to complete before proceeding further.\n\n## Multiprogramming\n\n> Opposite of uniprogramming. Still there will be some waiting time but at least it can be reduced and hence is better than uniprogramming.\n\n## Time sharing systems\n\n- The program is being shared through different users and different monitors. Thus, can be used to handle multiple interactive jobs.\n- Processor time is shared among multiple users.\n- This time is in milli or micro seconds. This is called short burst or quantum of computation.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-00-06-36.png)\n\n## OS Structure\n\n- _For general purpose OS, the program is very large._\n- Ways to structure OS\n  - Monolitic Approach (Analofy coding in C where there are no classes) - Everything combined in one place.\n    - Eg. Older LINUX and UNIX\n    - Advantages\n      - Speed as everything is connected\n      - Performance\n    - Disadvantages\n      - Difficult to maintain and modify\n  - Layered Approach - OS divided into number of layers.\n    - Layer 0 = hardware and Layer n = user interface layer\n    - A particular layer can use functions and services of **lower-level layers only (layers below it).**\n    - Eg. Older windows versions\n  - Microkernels - Move as much functionalities as possible to user mode from kernel mode. \n    - Unlike that in layered and monolithic where majority of the functionalities is available in only kernal mode.\n    - I\\\\O and interrupt management, primitive memory management, inter-process communication and basic scheduling were kept in kernel mode.\n    - All other functionalities will be running in user mode.\n    - Advantages\n      - Time is reduced significantly as the time to change the mode from user to kernel and vice versa is almost completely diminished.\n      - Porting of OS to newer architecture becomes easier (will be covered in upcoming lectures).\n      - More reliable because less code is running in kernel mode.\n      - More secure as less code has to be valudated in kernel.\n    - Disadvantages\n      - Performance overhead to change the mode.\n    - Eg. Mach, MINIX, Windows NT Client-Server\n  - Modules - Most moedern OS implement kernel modules\n    - These are loadable kernel module\n    - Uses OOP\n    - Similar to layers but is more flexible\n    - Eg. Device Drivers (These are loaded as needed within the kernel)\n    - Solaris Modular Approach (will be covered in upcoming lectures).\n  - Hybrid Approach - Combines multiple approaches to address performance, security and usability.\n    - Eg. Linux and Solaris = monolithich + modular, windows = monolithic + microkernel and Mac OS and IOS = Darwin which is microkernel and BSD Unix kernel implemented over layered model\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/FMoqldyy4MXfQQeX0aexm.html","relUrl":"notes/FMoqldyy4MXfQQeX0aexm.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 15","title":"Lecture 15","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Operating System.Lecture 15","content":"## Producer/Consumer (Cont.)\n\n> The question was what would happen if we changed the order in which semaphores are released?\n\n- Assume that in consumer, we are waiting for delay to restore.

![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-19-32.png)\n  - Suppose process 0 needs to enter into critical section every hour and process 1 needs to enter the critical section 1000 times in an hour.\n  - Now, it is suppose process 0 exits the critical section and allows process 1 to enter.\n  - turn variable is set 0 for the next 1 hour because process 0 is not going to go in the critical section.\n  - This means that process 1 will suffer.\n  - Secondly, if one process fails, the other process is permanently blocked.\n- Attempt 2\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-24-37.png)\n  - In this attempt, we continuously check the flag of other process and if it is false, then only enter the critical section.\n  - Furthermore, lock the critical section by toggling the flag and once the process leaves the critical section, toggle the flag to free the critical section for other processes.\n  -

Server pool of threads for each client, Word program checking spelling and displaying output at the same time.\n\n## Single Thread approach and Multi thread approach\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-16-52-16.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-16-53-25.png)\n\n## Relationship between process and multithreading\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-16-55-14.png)\n\n## Multithreaded environment\n\n- When we have one or more threads in process, each thread has the following\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-16-57-25.png)\n- Theoritical Definition: Thread is an **independent** program counter operating **within** a process.\n\n## Thread vs Process\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-00-26.png)\n- Recap: User address space contains the program and the data.\n- Thus, we can see that the user address space is shared with multiple threads within the same process.\n\n## Benefits of threads\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-04-46.png)\n\n## Case study - File Server Application\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-06-59.png)\n\n## Single User System\n\n- In file server, we can have multiple client requests and multiple threads, but in single user system, it is not the case.\n- Foreground/Background processes can be handled using threads individually.\n- Asynchronous Processing - Eg. Backing up in background.\n- Faster Execution - Read one set of data while processing another set.\n- Organization - Eg. For a word processing program, may allow one thread for each file being edited.\n\n## Management of thread at process level and similarities with processes\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-11-53.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-12-55.png)\n\n## Thread states and its operations\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-13-25.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-14-36.png)\n\n## Remote Procedure Call\n\n- It means that from one program, we are calling a procedure of another program in the remote machine.\n- Distributed computing concept starts with RPCs.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-16-34.png)\n- Single Thread Model\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-16-55.png)\n- Multi Thread Model\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-17-52.png)\n\n## Uniprocessor Multithreading\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-19-06.png)\n\n## Thread Synchronization\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-20-26.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-17-23-12.png)\n\n## Categories of Thread Implementation\n\n- User Level Threads (ULT)\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-19-32-18.png)\n  - Java supports ULT.\n  - Suppose that a thread is running and makes a system call.\n  - Since, it made a system call, it must go through the kernel.\n  - The kernel is not aware about the thread, it is only aware about the process and thus, the whole process gets blocked.\n  - Overall, the process state and thread state may not change simultaneously or concurrently.\n  - Advantage\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-19-41-26.png)\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-19-41-38.png)\n    - The different scheduling is done only for application and not done by the kernel as kernel is not aware about the threads.\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-19-43-51.png)\n  - Disadvantage\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-19-44-22.png)\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-19-44-39.png)\n- Kernel Level Threads (KLT)\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-22-45-15.png)\n  - Advantages\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-23-45-11.png)\n  - Disadvantages\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-23-45-33.png)\n\n## Combined Approach\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-12-23-49-04.png)\n- Eg.

But why do we need composite materials?\n\n- Reduce Weight\n- Lowers the cost of the material\n- Gives strength to the device\n- **Mediates propogation of charge/current**\n\n## Atomic structure\n\n- Atomic mass unit = 1/12 of the mass of most common isotope of carbon.\n- Atomic weight is weighted average of atomic masses of naturally occuring isotopes.\n- A mole is amount of matter with mass in grams equal to atomic mass in amu.\n- A mole of carbon has a mass of 12 grams.\n- **One mole has 6.023 x 10^23 number of atoms (also called as Avogadro's number)**\n- Number density formula: \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-15-14-09.png)\n\nHere Nav = avogadro's number, $\\\\rho$ = mass density and A = atomic mass\n\n- De broglie wavelength: \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-15-58-00.png)\n\n- Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-15-58-34.png)\n\n### Electronic Structure of isolated atoms\n\n- n  principal shell (1,2,3... or K,L,M...)\n- l = anular (sub shell) (s,p,d,f)\n- ml = magnetic (-l to +l including 0)\n- ms = spin (1/2, -1/2)\n\n> Ionization potential is the energy required to pull out a valence electron (in vacuum) and by convention it is positive. Electron affinity is energy gained by putting an electron in (from vacuum) and by convention it is negative.\n\n> Electronegativity is the measure of how likely an atom will take up or give up an electron.\n\n- Valence electrons determine the physical properties viz chemical, electrical, thermal and optical\n- Electropositive elements easily give up electrons to become positive ions. These generally rest in the left sife of the periodic table and vice versa for electronegative elements.\n- This means electronegativity is smaller on left side and larger on the right side.\n\n## Physical properties in Periodic table\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-08-27.png)\n\n## Bonding in solids\n\n- At large distances, interactions are negligible and at small distances each atom exerts forces on the other.\n- These include, force of attraction and that of repulsion.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-12-56.png)\n\n- Fnet = Fr + Fa. At equilibrium Fnet = 0\n- Usually the distance between the two atoms at equilibrium position is 0.3nm.\n\n## Potential Energy\n\n> **Here potential energy and energy are used interchangebly.**\n\n- Energy is integration of foice wrt the radius.\n- Enet = Ea + Er.\n- **Relation between force and energy is that energy is integration of force.**\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-17-07.png)\n\n- Attraction energy = -A/r and Repulsive energy = B/power(r,n)\n- E0 = Bonding energy at minimum distance. This means that it is the energy required to seperate two atoms to an infinite seperation.\n- It the curve above is deep, this implies that the material is rigid and inflexible and vice versa.\n- If the double derivative of the energy (equivalent to single derivative of force equation) equation at r = r0 is less than 0 then it is stable and vice versa.\n- To find the equalibrium position, make the single derivative of the energy equation (equivalent to the force equation) equal to 0.\n- The mechanical stiffness (elasticity) of a material is dependent on the shapr of its F vs r diagram.\n- Steep curve means relatively stiff and vice versa.\n\n## Ionic Bonding\n\n- Generally takes place between metals and non-metals. There is a complete transfer of electron.\n- **Difference between electronegativity is of prime importance. Ionic bonding only occurs between atoms with large differences in electronegativity.**\n- Cation = Positive Ion, Anion = Negative Ion\n- Primary Bonding means that electrons are completely transferred. Atoms do so to acheive stable configuration. Such type of bonding is very strong (columbic force in case of ionic bonding). (Eg. Ionic, Covalent and Metallic)\n- Ionic bonds are non-directional whereas covalent bonds are directional in nature. **Non-directional means that the magnitude of bond is equal in all directions around an ion.**\n- Secondary Bonding means that electrons are shared. This type of bonding is weaker compared to primary bonding. (Eg. inert gases (H2, Cl2) or permanet dipoles (H20, HCl))\n- Enet (due to all attractions and repulsions) is known as **madelung energy**.\n- The predominant bonding in **ceramic materials** is **ionic.**\n\n## Covalent Bonding\n\n- **Covalent bonding occurs between atoms with small differences in electronegativity.**\n- The stable electroninc configuration is achieved by **sharing of electrons**.\n- Generally occur between non-metals and is directional bond.\n- Number of colvalent bonds is determined by the number of valence electrons.\n- Percent of ionic characters:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-46-57.png)\n\n- Here Xa and Xb are the electronegativities of elements a and b. Greater the difference between electronegativities, greater is the ionic bonding and vice versa.\n\n## Metallic Bonding\n\n- Found in metals and their alloys.\n- According to the model presented, the valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom in the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal.\n- Thus, these are called as electron clound as the electrons are all over the metal.\n- The remaining non-valence electrons and nucleus form the ion core and **posses a net positive charge** equal to total valence electrons charge per atom.\n- The free electrons sheild the positively charged ion cores from mutually repulsive electrostatic forces along with acting as a **glue**.\n- Because of the availability of free electrons, metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity.\n\n## Van der waals bodning\n\n- All the above mentioned bonds are **primary** bonds and this type of bond is **secondary** in nature.\n- It is weaker as compared to primary bonds.\n- It is virtually ubiquitous but presence of primary bonds diminishes their effect.\n- Usually found between **inert gases**.\n- Dipoles are formed which exists whenever there is some separation of positive and negative portions of an atom or molecule.\n- Hydrogen bonding is a special type of secondary bonding that exists metweeb some molecules that have hydrogen as one of its constituents.\n\n## Summary of Bonding\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-50-27.png)\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/ZDhR31vX7QaUHjFhEevZt.html","relUrl":"notes/ZDhR31vX7QaUHjFhEevZt.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering.Lecture 1","content":"## Introduction to Material Science and Engineering\n\n## Points to Ponder\n\n- With slight change in physical properties, we can get a whole new material.

We don't read each and every news that comes on the feed, we **choose** to read only those that interests us.\n- Halo Effects\n  - Halo means angel which is ususally represented by a yellow circle above his head.\n  - It is the tendency to draw a **positive general impression** about an individual/product based on a single characteristic.\n  - Eg. People prefering apple products are not concerned with the competition and the features avaible in other phones and at what price and thus are **operating under the halo effect.**\n- Horn Effects\n  - Horns usually represent devil.\n  - It is the tendency to draw a **negative general impression** about an individual/product based on a single characteristic.\n  - Eg. Mother/daughter in law case.\n- Stereotyping\n  - It means that we are judging someone based on one's **perception of the group.**\n  - Eg.

After multiple iterations a child knows that when a telephone rings, we pick it up and talk. Similar is the case with wireless mobile phones but the range is low in wired case.\n- Thus, identifying the scheme is of prime importance. So, for the telephone example, the scheme is that whenever it rings, someone comes and picks it up.\n- Now, the new experience is of mobile phones. What to do when it rings? This has to be incorported by the child.\n- Operations\n  - Those actions that can be reversed or they are called reversible actions.\n  - Types of operations\n    - Cause and effect - Eg. Switch\n    - Conservation of substance - Eg. Clay\n- Four stages\n  - **Sensorimotor stage** (birth to 2 yrs) \n    - Focus on present object and not on the object that is not there.\n    - They have basic schmes of shaking, twisting, pushing etc. (inbuilt)\n  - **Preoperational stage** (2 to 7 years)\n    - Think about the objects that are not present.\n    - Don't think of reversible consequence of actions.\n    - Use perception rather than logic.\n    - Eg. Water in different shapes of container.\n  - **Concrete-Operational stage** (7 to 11 yrs)\n    - These are tied to their actual experiences.\n    - Eg. Water in bottle to glass\n    - **They are not able to generalise the results to all the types of substances.**\n    - They are not able to think in hypothetical situations.\n  - **Formal-Operational stage** (11 to 16 yrs)\n    - Notice similarites between operations performed on different objects.\n    - **They are able to generalise the results obtained in one situations to other situations.**\n    - They can now think in hypothetical world.\n    - Eg. How much air does a room contain? It is the volume of the room.\n\n## Vigotsky's Theory\n\n- Its main principle is that children develop in the social world by interacting with other people and products of their cultural history.\n- Eg. Child born in a tribe and in a modern family.\n  - The difference between learning language in modern family and that in tribe would be of written documentation.\n  - Tribe people might not have a written manuscript of the symbols and language that they use whereas modern family have perfectly well maintained documentation of the rules and regulations of their language.\n  - Thus, a child in tribe might learn about only the spoken part and not the written part whearas in modern family, a child learns both.\n- Social elements\n  - Symbols\n  - Knowledge\n  - Ideas\n  - Mode of reasoning\n\n## Difference in perspective of both theories\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-11-44-22.png)\n- In the above example, from piaget's perspective, the child discovered the rule of commutativity because the child acted on the pebbles (physical environment) and while playing with it.\n- From the vigotsky's perspective, the child belongs to the community where they know how to count or at least that community value counting because of which the child started counting.\n- Otherwise, the child could have done numerous other activities with the pebbles like throwing it, catching it etc.\n- This also means that the community also has some symbols that facilitate counting.

It is also called as **facade**\n  - Fourth - Information that I as well as others are not aware about. It is also called **unknown/dark.**\n- Objective of Johari Window\n  - Increase the area in **arena** which means the open area/free self\n- We can disclose the information that we know and others don't to increase arena.\n- As for the information that others know but we don't, we take the feedback and increase arena.\n- These include behaviour, attitude, feelings, knowledge, experience and skills at an individual level.\n- For the organization, arena is very small and to increase this area, we need to open up to the team assigned. We should also be ready to seek feedback. Furthermore other members should not feel that they are being judged.\n- To reduce the fourth quadrant, we need to have as many diverse experiences as possible at individual level. At manager level, we can conduct various kinds of interesting activiteis where other members open up. We must provide new opportunities for others to gain diverse experiences.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/2wrY2jTIiZAARQpIh6pvX.html","relUrl":"notes/2wrY2jTIiZAARQpIh6pvX.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 17","title":"Lecture 17","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Identity and Behaviour.Lecture 17","content":"\n# Job Dissatisfaction and Job Crafting\n\n## Extra Points\n* Job satisfaction is the positive feeling that we associate with our jobs.\n* To measure it we have two methods\n    * Global rating which just asks one question that all things considered, how satisfied are you with your jobs?\n    * Very quick\n    * Summation of key aspects\n        * Type of work, skills needed, supervision, pay, growth, culture etc.\n        * Very detailed but time consuming.\n* There are two worlds\n    * Empirical i.e the visible world.\n    * Conceptual i.e virtual world.\n    * We can see empirical world and make inferences about conceptual world but it can't be reversed.\n\n## Introduction\n* Negative feeling when you assess aspects of your job.\n* Behaviours individuals may engage because of job dissatisfaction.\n    * Leaving\n    * CWB\n    * Productivity joes less\n    * Work half heartedly\n    * Complain/Report to the organization\n* Impact\n    * Constructive and destruction for **organiation**.\n    * Active and passive for the **individual**.\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-31-14-39-36.png)\n    * EXIT - Leaving the job.\n    * VOICE - Reporting/feedback given by the employee.\n    * LOYALTY - Kattappa from Bahubali.\n    * NEGLECT - Not doing any work, disobey and are not taking any active steps.\n        * Worse then EXIT because here we dont know for sure about an individual whereas in EXIT, we definitely know that the individual is going and we need to hire another one.\n\n## Counterproductive Work Behaviour (CWB)\n* Engaging in some other work that is not productive to the organization in the time allocated for the productive work for the organization.\n* This happens mainly because the employee feels a sense of injustice.\n> What can be done in these cases?\n* Try to find reasons for dissatisfaction by conductiong a survey or asking for feedback.\n* Measure CWB and identify areas of workplace improvement.\n* Creating teams, formal policies and incentivizing teams can help reduce CWB.\n\n## Absenteeism\n* Consistent negative relationship with job satisfaction.\n* Higher job options results in high absenteeism because they are constantly giving interviews and would want to leave their current job.\n\n## Turnover\n* Intention to leave the organization.\n* Positive relationship between leaving and dissatisfaction.\n* This is stronger than absenteeism because in absenteeism it is possible than individual is not looking for a job but is not being present for the organization but here, the individual has already decided to leave the organization.\n* It is high in places with higher job options.\n* **Push and pull effect**\n    * Something happens that makes the sense of injustice even more stronger and you are pushed to leave the organization is called push effect.\n    * Pull effect means individual is not seeking other job currently even though he or she is dissatisfied with the job.\n    * But then competitors approach them and ask to leave their job is called pull effect.\n\n> What should be done by managers?\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-31-16-27-48.png)\n\n## Job Crafting\n* Process of delibrately reorganizing your job so that it better fits your motives, strengths and passions.\n* Eg.

The moisture gets trapped in the pores and when it heats up, the moisture escapes and the wood shrinks.\n- It it shrinks by reducing the length, it is called **cracking** whereas if it rotates as a result of shrinking, it is called **warping**.\n\n## Directions of wood\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-16-29-58.png)\n- There is a steady flow of water as long as trunk is connected to the roots.\n- The moment it is cut, the water will escape slowly.\n- As a result, the wood will begin to shrink.\n- Thus, we require to cut the wood in a very specific manner/direction such that there is minimum amount of shrinking.\n- Wood has **anisotropic/directional** property which means it has different properties in different directions.\n- This means that percentage of shrinkage will be different in different directions.\n- If the wood is cut along the longitudinal direction, there will be minimum shrinking.\n- But, cutting accross longitudinal directions will not result in long planks of wood.\n- Thus, we cut the wood in radial direction only as it has lower shrinkage percentage then longitudinal and will result in longer planks.\n- The water content, if the wood cut in the tangential direction, is more and thus there would be more shrinking whereas it is not the case in longitudinal and radial direction.\n- Calculating the age of wood with the help of rings is called **dendrochronology**.\n- The seasonal adaption in the radial direction is the reason of lower warping and thus it won't change anymore.\n\n## Shrinkage Curve\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-16-43-56.png)\n\n## Grains of wood\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-16-44-43.png)\n\n## Deterioration\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-16-52-12.png)\n- Physical Degradation\n  - Warping\n  - Cracking\n  - Splitting\n- If the wood loses lignin (binding agent), the wood will develop crack because it will try to fall apart.\n- The outer particles in wood will pull the inner wood in opposite direction resulting in a large straight crack.\n- Swelling and shrinking can also result into network of cracks instead of straight crack.\n- Chemical Degradation\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-16-58-26.png)\n  - **Pulp** is the precipitate that you obtain when you dissolve wood in either strong acid or strong alkali.\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- % shirinkage in\n  - Longitudinal Direction - 0.1% - 0.2%\n  - Radial Direction - 1% - 2%\n  - Tangential Direction - 6% - 12%\n- **Polychrome wood** means that wood is colored (in fact it is multicolored).\n- The sculptures made of wood are generally not carved from single wood.\n- They are joined seperately.

This immense heating causing chemically binded water to detach from the clay making it very hard.\n- **Note that the temperature when firing the clay should be raised slowly and not drastically.**\n- This is because clay is porous and when firing, chemically bonded water will try to escape. Now, if suddenly the temperature is raised then the chemically bonded water will not escape suddenly.\n- Instead, the silica fuses into one another trapping the chemically bonded water.\n- Now, at high temperatures, these chemically bonded water turns into steam creating air bubbles.\n- As a result, the clay will disintegrate immediately. Same applies for cooling too. You have to cool the clay very slowly.\n\n## Colors of material at different temperature\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-10.png)\n\n## Quartz Inversion Temperature\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-43.png)\n- Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2) and has a trigonal crystalline structure called as alpha-quartz.\n- At 573 degrees it gets converted into beta-quartz which is hexagonal in shape.\n- So now, it holds clay at 6 points unlike earlier where it holded clay at only 3 points.\n- Now, because of this beta-quartz, the properties of silica change and thus, becomes impervious to water damage.\n- Now, if we cool the clay as soon as it reached 573 degrees, only some part of clay will get converted and majority will disintegrate as soon as it comes in contact of water.\n- Therfore, it is of vital importance that we keep the clay at least equal to 573 degrees for about 2-3 hrs. It depends on how big is the pot.\n- Finally, after quartz inversion takes place, clay turns into ceramics.\n\n## Sintering\n\n- This is the next phase of clay firing starting at 900 degrees.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-33-49.png)\n- **After this phase, the water will be retained because of fusion of clay particles.**\n- Pores get removed due to exertion of pressure on each silica particle.\n- This process is called **solid phase sintering.**\n\n## Vitrification\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-41-09.png)\n- After solid phase sintering, there might be some pores that are still left which may allow water to pass.\n- Thus, this next phase is crucial to cover all the pores.\n- In order to lower the melting point of silica, flux is added.\n- Flux is **glassy** in nature. In fact, vitri means glass case.\n- Flux are oxides of metals like calcium, sodian, magnesium, lead, potassion, manganese etc.\n- Now, these oxides (in power form) melt at 1600 degrees and form a liquid.\n- This liquid flows into the pores and solidifies there making the clay fully impervious.\n- This process is called **liquid phase sintering.**\n- **Here, note that silica particles are not melting. It is the flux that is melting.**\n\n## Glazing\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-52-17.png)\n- It beautifies clay by giving it a feel of glass.\n- **Vitreous means glassy.**\n\n## Summary of stages of clay\n\n- Quartz inversion\n- Solid phase sintering\n- Liquid phase sintering (vitrification).\n- This turns clay to ceramics.\n- Glaze\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- Melting point of silica = 2000 degress.\n\n* * *\n\n## Wood\n\n- This is an organic material and is found in nature.\n- Made from cellulose and bio-organisms can decay these materials.\n- Carving would be easier on wood rather than that on stone because wood is way more softer than stone.\n- Wood is higly porous.\n\n## Surfaces of wood\n\n- Inlay\n  - Insertion of stone by making a fine cut in the wood.\n- Paint\n- Varnish\n- Gilded\n  - Gold leaf is applied with plaster like substance (to provide adhesiveness to gold leaf) to give wood a appearance of metal.\n- Lacquer\n  - Dip the material in lac which develop aesthetic cracks.\n\n## Important timbers\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-01.png)\n\n## Types of wood\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-47.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-11-49.png)\n\n## Components of wood\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-12-21.png)\n- If all the water is lost from the wood, then the wood would shrink and vice versa.\n- The exansion and contraction takes place in wood to a great extent. This is because wood is made of cellulose.\n- This changes the shape of wood and this process if called warping of wood.\n- Polysaccharides gives wood its woody appearance. They are just mixture of sugar.\n- Hemicellulose is branched chain and cellulose is composed of mixture of unbranched chain. Former is a mixture of sugar whereas latter is the mixture of glucose.\n- Lignin acts as a binding agent and gives wood its hardness and softness. This means that if lignin is less than bonding is less and vice versa.\n- **Phenol is aromatic alcohol.**\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/pqNpCLStu5xEH6DUzpCYe.html","relUrl":"notes/pqNpCLStu5xEH6DUzpCYe.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 6","title":"Lecture 6","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 6","content":"## Steel and Ceramics\n\n## Stainless Steel\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-10-25-39.png)\n- Chromium oxide layer is impervious layer.

Silver is very low in quantity.\n  - First zinc and copper is melted and then the object is dipped in copper sulphate solution to obtain a blackish color.\n  - This black is temporary.\n  - Now, with metallic stylus, designs are engraved. It is a very sharp metallic point/tool.\n  - Then, they take silver wire and hammer it in those grooves and thus this silver design is made. This is called silver inlay.\n  - Now, to smoothen the surface, it is polished. With regorous polishing, all the temporary black goes away and the entire silvery surface turns white.\n  - In final preparation, **mud of bidar** + water + dilute ammonium chloride and a dough is made and then you rub this object.\n  - By doing this, all the zinc area becomes permanent black.\n  - Silver does not become black because silver is less reactive then zinc and hence does not get converted to black color.\n  - **Silver only reacts with sulphide. This is chloride.**\n\n## Ceramics\n\n> Made of clay. It is neither metallic nor organic. Clay is the final product of weathering of rock.\n\n- Clay is basically silica and alumina. (SiO2 and Al2O3).\n- When you introduce water, clay becomes really soft and it disintegrates easily.\n- To overcome this problem, we heat the clay at very high temperature and as a result, it becomes very hard and dense.\n- So basically, on heating we are removing water and hence it looses its plasticity.\n- Terracotta army\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-02-41.png)\n  - Terra means earth\n  - Terracota is basically fired clay.\n  - Brick is made of terracota.\n- BASIC Materials\n- Stucco is made from unbaked clay or sunbaked clay. It is not fired but is sunbaked and hence becomes crucial to study.\n- It is majorly found in Gandhara, Afghanistan.\n\n## Types of clay\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-15-46.png)\n- Terracota comes under erathenware. It gets red color due to inclusion of iron.\n- Bone china is a type of porcelain and fired at 1350 degrees and is mostly white in color.\n- White colored clay called kaolin is used to make bone china.\n\n## Stages of clay\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-18-04.png)\n- Bisuqe is also called as bicuit firing and is the first firing stage.\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- When you keep on heating/firing any material, the ultimate color it will emit will always be white.\n- This happens because of the stages of heating. In the first stage, the carbon layer is burnt and is black in color.\n- Now on further increasing the temperature, you will see orange color and then becomes red and then it becomes ash colored (grey) and finally becomes white.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/h0aElhzUHPZcwCbVHJpRn.html","relUrl":"notes/h0aElhzUHPZcwCbVHJpRn.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 5","title":"Lecture 5","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 5","content":"## Patina and Metal Oxide\n\n## Patina Continued.\n\n- Any layer that is formed on the metal surface is called patina.\n- Layers\n  - Oxide\n  - Carbonate\n  - Sulphate\n  - Acetate\n  - Chloride\n- Those patina which is protective in nature is called noble patina and those that are corrosive in nature are called malignant patina.\n- Cuprous oxide (Brown) and cupric oxide (Black) is noble patina as they do not react and protect copper metal.\n- Greenish layer deposited on copper is carbonate layer.\n  - It is also known as malachite.\n  - **Noble patina** but in very rare cases it is malignant patina.\n- **Malignant Patina (Bronze Disease)**\n  - Bronze metals form chloride layer (atacamite and nantokite).\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-00-05-28.png)\n    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-00-06-37.png)\n\n## Malachite and Azurite formation\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-23-50-53.png)\n- Two forms of carbonate layer.\n- Carbonate ions are formed when carbon dioxide is dissoved in water.\n- We may also get carbonic acid in a similar fashion.\n- On scratching a corroded metal, we get pure metal inside it.

Thus, we can say that the non-metallic quality of metal increases.\n- **Magnetic effect** is used to detect how much **core metal** is left and how much **rust** is formed.\n\n## Electrochemical Series\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-24-30.png)\n- The metals here are placed according to their decreasing reactivity. Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.\n- Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.\n- It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.\n- Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations. Another reason for that use is that it is an excellent conductor of electrivity.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-29-17.png)\n- Oxidation \n  - When a metal looses electron. \n  - The power to loose electron is called oxidation potential.\n  - Lesser reactive metals have lower oxidation potential than more reactive metals.\n- Reduction\n  - When a metal gains electron.\n  - The power to gain electron is called reduction potential.\n  - Lesser reactive metals have higher reduction potential than more reactive metals.\n- Reducing agent is a more reactive metal that displaces a metal from its sulfate state and vice versa.\n- In metallic terms, oxidation is also called corrosion.\n\n## Galvanic Cell\n\n- Also known as Voltaic cell or Daniel cell or Electrochemical cell\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-39-33.png)\n- Electrode is a solid electrical conductor that carries a current. Two types include anode and cathode.\n- Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.\n- Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.\n- Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.\n- This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.\n- So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.\n- **To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.**\n- Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.\n- Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection. (Used mainly for protecting silver by coating gold on it).\n\n## Tarnising of silver\n\n- Silver is almost a noble metal and hence it is very difficult for it to corrode.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-53-23.png)\n- Color is black.\n- Oxygen can not harm silver but sulfur can.\n- Only on the surface.\n- We preserve tarnished silver to preserve silver and it also represent age and authenticity in silver artifacts.\n- Patina is just a layer and surface discoloration. It is a surface phenomena.\n- Silver sulfide layer is called as noble patina because it is non reactive.\n- Oxide layer on broze is blackish in color or called as blackish patina.\n- Cuprous oxide layer is brownish in color and later it will change to cupric oxide which is more stable and is blackish in color.\n\n## Types of oxide\n\n- Unstable metal oxide - Gold, Silver and Platinum\n- Stable metal oxide - Copper, Tin and Lead\n- Volatile metal oxide - Molebdenum\n- Porous metal oxide - Sodium, Potassium, Manganese and iron.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/BgcXxxpb6DisRJsyHHte4.html","relUrl":"notes/BgcXxxpb6DisRJsyHHte4.html"},{"doc":"Metals","title":"Metals","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 3","content":"## Hardness of Stones and Introduction to metals\n\n## Mohs Hardness Scale\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-14-42-38.png)\n- Gypsum\n  - Used as one of the raw components of cement and its called calcium sulphate.\n  - It is really soft.\n- Calcite\n  - Chief component of limestone and marble.\n  - It is called Calcium Carbonate\n- Quartz\n  - It is very hard.\n  - Used in sandstone and granite\n  - Hence, these materials are also hard.\n  - It is called silicon dioxide.\n  - Harder than Gypsum and Calcite as evident from the above figure.\n  - Artifacts of sandstone have different colors like shown in below image.\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-05-34.png)\n  - This means that if **iron content** is more, then it **gives red** color and if **clay content** is more, then it **gives yellow** color.\n  - The red color of the red fort is red because of ferruginous sandstone.

Marble is a porous stone.**\n\n  > Why is it not the reverse?\n  >\n  > - This is because, sandstone is a stronger than marble and hence has the capacity to hold the weight of marble.\n\n- Biwi ka maqbara, Aurangabad\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-16-57.png)\n  - Made using a very fine and polished limestone and only 25% marble is used.\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- Average temperature of venus is 470 degrees.\n- Mars surface temperature is -53 degrees.\n- Earth's surface temperature earlier was 290 degrees and nowadays it is 15 degrees.\n  > What was the climatic condition that led it to cool down?\n  >\n  > - It was covered with Carbon Dioxide, but during formation of limestone, more than 80% of the gas was consumed and thus, the earth's surface temperature cooled.\n- During the production of cement, we are reversing the formation of limestone.\n- Thus, we are releasing a lot of carbon dioxide.\n- Stones used in formation of qutub minar are marble, sandstone and **quartzite.**\n- Based on quartizite, Alai Minar in Delhi was made. Originally, it was supposed to be a replica of Qutub Minar with double height, but could not be completed.\n- Kailashnath Temple, Ellora is made using Basalt which is extrunious igneous rock formed by volcanic rocks.\n- Brihadishwar Temple, Tanjavur is made using granite.\n- **Anything that has to migrate from one surface to other surface, the other surface must be more porous compared to the first one.**\n\n\n- Most of the metals are subject to corrosion due to atmospheric moisture.\n- Metals used in heritage\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-37-31.png)\n  - These metals are placed in the order of their corrsion resistance and hardness.\n  - **There is a mistake in the photo.

It has polar (head) and non polar (tail) ends.\n- The water is binded to head and oil to tail and a suspension is created.\n- But the paint formed is can not be used to paint because the microorganisms can grow in the suspension.\n- Thus, we add deformer which is a dispersing agent preventing the microorganisms to grow.\n\n## Fresco Painting\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-14-49-39.png)\n- It is majorly used in wall paintings.\n- Types\n  - Fresco Buono\n    - Freshly applied\n    - Binder/adhesive is not added.\n    - But to bind, they prepare a lime plaster everyday and dry powders are applied to it when it is wet.\n    - **Pigment is applied when the wall (lime plastered) is wet.**\n    - **One day's work/job reference here.**\n  - Fresco Secco\n    - Dried\n    - **Pigment is applied on dry plaster.**\n    - Pigment is mixed in lime water and applied on dry plaster.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-14-53-26.png)\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- Function of binder is two folded.\n- It binds the pigment powders together.\n- It makes the paint adhere onto the painted surface.\n- Function of vehicle is to give the binder flow which in turn provides the flow to the binder.\n- The oil in oil painting has to be such that it can dry and binds the paint.\n- Musturd oil, olive oil and groundnut oil are  one such oil that **can't be used.**\n- Drying oil includes linseed oil, poppyseed oil and walnut oil.\n- Drying of oil does not mean evaporation, it means that the oil is oxidized and cross linked.\n- Oxidation makes the oil dry and cross linking makes the oil hard.\n- Cross linking simply means that the molecules of oil get tangled into one another.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/AxTfLkjsVSwfFSGpL22WS.html","relUrl":"notes/AxTfLkjsVSwfFSGpL22WS.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 14","title":"Lecture 14","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 14","content":"## Paintings (Cont.)\n\n## Types of paint\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-12-16-38.png)\n\n## Encaustic Painting\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-12-17-24.png)\n- Made using pigment + wax + heated gum/iron.\n\n## Watercolor Painting\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-12-18-50.png)\n- Pigment and Binder are very low and solvent/vehicle (water) is very high.\n\n## Tempera Painting\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-12-20-06.png)\n\n## Goache Painting\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-12-23-27.png)\n\n## Difference between the three\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-12-30-49.png)\n\n## Casein Painting\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-12-36-12.png)\n\n## Oil Painting\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-12-36-33.png)\n- Pigment is earth colors, binder and vehicle is oil.\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- Varnish acts as a protective layer and it enhances the colors also.\n- Thus, if the dusts settles on painting, we remove the varnish layer and recoat it with varnish.\n- This way the paintings are preserved for a long time.\n- Sometimes binder acts as both binder and vehicle to let the paint flow.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/FX33XpJ5ZUrNaOcyLVhsQ.html","relUrl":"notes/FX33XpJ5ZUrNaOcyLVhsQ.html"},{"doc":"Paintings","title":"Paintings","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 13","content":"## Textiles (Cont.)\n\n## Assignment Details\n\n- Individual Assignment\n  - 10 Marks\n  - Take any object from home and write properties and problems that you observe.\n- Group Assignment\n  - 20 Marks\n  - 2 people in a group\n  - Visit any nearby museum, see the gallery and write a bried report about the display, materials and the environment (microclimate - interior environment)\n  - Look at dust and durt\n  - Lighting conditions\n  - Humidity/Relative Humidity level\n  - Access to pollution\n  - Access to pests/insects etc\n- Deadline is October 31, 2021\n- Write small, precise and not copied.\n\n## Physical Properties of Silk\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-32-00.png)\n- Most of the natural fibers are not strong but silk is.\n- This is because it is a filament fibre and thus there are no joints.\n- Pure silk is raw silk obtained directly fromthe silk worm.\n- Spun silk is left over silk or damanged fibres.\n- Silk is protien based fibre. Thus, it has a protien called serisin which is a type of gum.\n- Thus, silk is degummed to protect it from pests.\n- As a result, it looses weight and weight is added by adding sugar or tanins.\n- It becomes weighted silk.\n\n## Chemical Properties of Silk\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-37-27.png)\n\n## Physical Properties of Wool\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-38-26.png)\n\n## Chemical Properties of Wool\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-39-13.png)\n\n## Physical Properties of Rayon\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-40-01.png)\n- **Rayon is also called as regenerated cellulose.

We initially get a blue color because of copper present in cupra ammonium hydroxide.\n- It is also called viscose rayon and cupra ammonium rayon.\n- **Cotton is still stronger than rayon even though rayon is filament fibre.**\n- This is because in rayon most part is amorphous whereas in cotton, most part is crystalline.\n\n* * *\n\n- Paintings come in the category of composite materials.\n- It is a combination of inorganic and organic materials.\n- Structure of canvas painting\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-48-55.png)\n- Paint is composed of three materials\n  - Pigments - Powder form obtained from earth colors, minerals, vegetables etc.\n  - Binder - Add some glue\n  - Solvent (Generally water) - This we call as vehicle as it adds **flow** to the paint.\n\n## Pigment\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-56-12.png)\n- Inorganic Pigments\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-56-41.png)\n\n## Binder\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-57-42.png)\n\n## Solvent\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-58-18.png)\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/kdLnuBXkmjIhTuv2kY5Mv.html","relUrl":"notes/kdLnuBXkmjIhTuv2kY5Mv.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 12","title":"Lecture 12","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 12","content":"## Textiles\n\n## Properties\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-21-58-52.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-21-59-10.png)\n- **Note that the only natural fibre available as filament fibre is silk.**\n- **Most of the natural fibres are staple except silk which is a filament fibre.**\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-22-21-12.png)\n- As it can be seen filament fibres are stronger than staple fibres.\n- Further, the filament fibres are smooth (because there are no joints) whereas staple fibers are rough (because they have several joints).\n- Thus, almost all synthetic clothes are smooth.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-22-23-47.png)\n- Cotton has high wrinkles whereas wool does not.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-22-28-46.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-22-30-41.png)\n\n## Difference between cellulose fibres and synthetic fibres\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-22-36-20.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-22-40-32.png)\n\n## Physical Properties of Cotton\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-22-44-02.png)\n\n## Chemical Properties of Cotton\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-22-47-06.png)\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- Wool has great capacity to hold water.

Wool has vice versa effect.\n- **All textiles have high absorption property because it is made of cellulose and hence is hydrophilic**.\n- Cotton is quite resistant to alkalis even to strong ones whereas wool is highly resistant to acids.\n- Thus for wool, you want acidic conditions whereas for cotton you want alkaline conditions and hence they are not washed/cleaned together.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/MysriMc7fI4d7ITyeuTJL.html","relUrl":"notes/MysriMc7fI4d7ITyeuTJL.html"},{"doc":"Textiles","title":"Textiles","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 11","content":"## Paper (Cont.)\n\n## Bleaching (Cont.)\n\n- Oxidising and reducing bleaching agents.\n- Chromophoric groups are the functional groups that impart color to paper.\n- Bleaching agent breaks down these groups by changing the double bond of chromophoric groups into single bond.\n- They change the optical properties of chromophoric groups.\n- As a result, the paper becomes white.\n\n## Sizing and Loading\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-18-40-57.png)\n- These process gives dimensional stability to paper.\n- Sizing (a material that is amphiphilic) has two purposes\n  - Blocks the pores in paper\n  - Does not let the ink to pass through\n- Loading material is added to increase the weight of paper.\n- Chalk is one of the loading material. \n- But on adding chalk it provides glossiness to the paper.\n- Thus, to remove it we need some other chemical process.\n- Optical brightning agents are used for increasing the brightness of the paper.\n\n## Inks\n\n- Carbon ink\n  - Lamp Black ink or soot of lamp.\n  - Collect the carbon soot from a burning lamp and use it as ink.\n  - Oil is also there which binds the ink onto the paper.\n- Iron gall ink\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-18-52-36.png)\n  - Chemical name of iron gall ink is ferrous tannate.\n  - It is soluble in water but when it is exposed to atmospheric oxygen it is converted to ferric tannate.\n  - This is permanent insoluble in water.

This means enabling local interrupts.**\n- Note that we do not have to manually update the value of status register, we just have to call sei() function in C to enable the global interrupt.\n- Similarly to disable global interrupt, we have to call cli() function in C.\n- Status Registers\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-11-33-07.png)\n  - Note that D7 is the MSB that represents globally enabling interrupt.\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-11-34-26.png)\n- sei() and cli() enables and disables **global interrupt** respectively.\n- TIMSK - Timer interrupt mask register\n  - Note that right now we are concerned with **internal interrupt** only.\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-11-36-05.png)\n  - This means that if you set the appropriate bit (for us, since we are using timer0, we set TOIE0 = 1).\n  - Thus, we write TIMSK = (1&lt;&lt;TCIE0) for enabling **local interrupt.**\n- interrupt service routine (ISR) (VECTOR TABLE)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-07-48-38.png)\n- TIMER0_OVF_vect means that we are sending overflow flag as a parameter to ISR which will enable the overflow flag **on interrupt** and set the program counter's value to the corresponding location.\n- Now inside ISR, we perform timer related operations i.e reassigning TCNT0 value and toggling PORTB's value for generating square.\n\n## Steps in executing an interrupt\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-07-53-22.png)\n- Interrupt Vector Table\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-10-24-57.png)\n  - After the first step is completed, based on the interrupt given, the program counter goes to that particular vector address as per the above image shown.\n\n## External Input\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-10-40-57.png)\n- The red colored pins are external interrupts.\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-07-52-43.png)\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/yZqS3ZassMgzGRQoVUSK6.html","relUrl":"notes/yZqS3ZassMgzGRQoVUSK6.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 4","title":"Lecture 4","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Embedded Systems.Lecture 4","content":"## Timers (Cont.)\n\n> Program to generate square wave of time period 100 micro second on Pin 1 of Port A and clock frequency of 1Mz\n\n```c\n#include<avr/io.h>\n\nvoid T0Delay() {\n    TCNT0 = 206; // Time delay is of 50 microseconds and not 100 microseconds.\n    TCCR0 = 0x01; // Normal mode and no prescaling\n    while((TIFR & 0x1) == 0); // Check for counter\n    TCCR0 = 0; // Stop the clock\n    TIFR = 0x1; // Reset flags\n}\n\nint main() {\n    DDRA = 0x02; // Define PIN 1 of PORTA to be ouput\n    while(1)\n    {\n        PORTA = 0x02; // Turn PIN 1 of PORTA on\n        T0Delay(); // Provide time delay\n        PORTA = 0x00; // Turn PIN 1 of PORTA off\n        T0Delay(); // Proivde time delay\n        // This will generate a square wave form.\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n* * *\n\n> ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-11-42-59.png)\n\n- The outside signal will come from pins of ports as they can have alternate functions too.\n- These pins will take the input from port.\n- Follow this for more functions\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-11-44-23.png)\n- For internal purpose, assume that the clock frequency is 1Mz. **Note that 1Hz is from outside world.**\n\n```c\n#include<avr/io.h>\n\nint main() {\n    DDRB = 0x00; // Declare whole port as input because this is where external signal will arrive.\n    DDRC = 0xFF; // Declare whole port as output because this is where we will be displaying the count of TCNT.\n    PORTB = 0x00; // Set PORTB to 0\n    while(1) { // Run forever\n        TCCR0 = 0x06; // External clock with falling edge value from the table\n        PORTC = TCNT0; // Display contents of TCNT0 on PORTC\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## CTC Mode\n\n- It is compare mode. This means that instead of going till 0xFF, it will drop at the set value.\n- It may or may not be equal to 0xFF.\n- Now to compare the flag, we compare with 0x02. (i.e flag 1 instead of flag 0).\n- **This is because the overflow flag is not affected, the compare flag is affected.**\n\n> Program to generate a square wave of time period 150 microseconds on PIN 1 of PORT A. Assume cystal frequency = 1MHz. use timer in CTC mode.\n\n- Note that the delay of 150 microseconds is for the whole wave.\n- Thus, if we need a delay for only one part of the wave, we need to use a delay of 75 microseconds.\n- Now we want to write the value of OCR0.\n- Make sure to change the value of TCCR0 for CTC mode.\n- Now, the time duration will depend not only on TCNT0 but also on OCR0.\n- In normal mode, we are concerned with FF - TCNT0 value but here we are concerned with OCR0 - TCNT0 which must be 75.\n- Note that one must always be careful about which flag are we going to use.\n- In **normal mode**, we are waiting for **overflow flag** whereas in **CTC mode** we are waiting for the **compare flag**.\n- For simplicity, you can put TCNT0 value to be 0 and OCR0 value to be 75. **The concept remains the same i.e OCR-TCNT should be 75.**\n-\n\n```c\n#include<avr/io.h>\n\nvoid T0Delay() {\n    TCNT0 = 0; // TCNT0 = 0\n    OCR0 = 75; // OCR0 - TCNT0 = 75 and TCNT0 = 0\n    TCCR0 = 0x09; // TCCR0 value for CTC mode and no prescaling\n    while( (TIFR & 0x2) == 0); // Check 1st bit\n    TCCR0 = 0; // Stop clock\n    TIFR = 0x2; // Reset flags\n}\n\nint main() {\n    DDRA = 0x02; // Set PORTA.1 as output pin\n    while(1) { // Run forever\n        PORTA = PORTA ^ 0x02; // Toggle value at PORTA\n        T0Delay(); // Apply time delay\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n- Now suppose, we start the value of TCNT0 with 200, then how will the OCR value change?\n- For this case, we find the extra distance i.e find from where it \"rolls over\".\n- Thus, the value of OCR must be 19 becuase from 200 to 256, we would have covered 56 values and then 19 values remain to provide a proper delay of 75 microseconds.\n\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/2gfrJVatHlxIKFBoN5ywR.html","relUrl":"notes/2gfrJVatHlxIKFBoN5ywR.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 3","title":"Lecture 3","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Embedded Systems.Lecture 3","content":"## Timer (Cont.)\n\n## Extra Points\n\n- If prescaling is applied, we multiply the time period of the AVR microcontroller by the same amount as the prescaling ratio.\n- Prescaler simply means that we are increasing the time period of the clock. Consequently, we are decreasing the frequency of the clock.\n- Time Delay\n  - Hex Value\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-10-19.png)\n  - Decimal Value\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-11-09.png)\n- To clear any flag, write logic **\"1\"** to it.\n\n## Steps for programming\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-23-39.png)\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-32-17.png)\n\n> Question that remains is how to store/measure overflow flag?\n>\n> - For that we use TIFR (Timer/Counter Interrupt Flag Register). It has dedicated 1-bit to store every flag that we may encounter.\n\n## TIFR Circuit\n\n- It is an 8-bit register.\n\n- Stores flags and **overflow flag is set on 0th bit**.\n\n- Value \"1\" implies overflowed and vice versa.\n  > The below given figure will be provided for reference in exam.\n\n- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-37-11.png)\n\n- Prescalers slows down the clock. Hence increases the time period.\n\n- Thus, multiply the prescaler to clock time period to get the adequate delay.\n\n- Overflow flag is located on 0th bit. Hence to check overflow we check TIFR & 0x1 to be 0.\n\n- **Make sure that to reset the flag by putting \"1\" to the flag.**\n\n- The reason for this could be understood using an analogy. These are not the direct registers. These like control registers which means they act as a switch. We are pressing the \"reset\" switch (by putting \"1\") and in turn it is telling the actual register to reset the values. Thus, instead of 0, we are passing 1.\n\n- Example questions\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-40-28.png)\n  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-42-27.png)\n  - Toggle bits on 4th Pin of PORTB continuously with delay of 70 microseconds.

It would all be automated and done by github actions.\n* Steps\n    * Go to github actions tab on the site.\n    * Click create new workflow.\n    * Under the continuous integration workflows, click more  continuous integration workflows.\n    * Select the **Python application** and click set up this workflow.\n        * name: Self-explanatory\n        * on: when do you want to trigger the scripts\n        * push: Implies that the scripts will trigger on push\n        * branches: On which branch shall the \"event\" (push, pull etc) occur, so as to trigger CI workflow.\n        * jobs: **Most important part.**\n        * build: We specify whether we are building or deploying (write deploy instead of build to let it know that its a deploy script)\n        * runs-on: Remote desktop offered by **github.**\n        * steps: Self-explanatory\n        * uses: preferable keep it actions/checkout@v2. It implies that we are just building and not deploying. For deploying we will need to \"ssh\" into the server and hence we will need to change this.\n        * name: name of the script\n        * uses: Since, we selected python, keep it as it is.\n        * with: Specify the version, for us it would be a python version.\n        * run: Here write the script for building your project\n        ```bash\n        pip install flake8\n        pip install pytest\n        cd frontend\n        npm install\n        npm run build\n        ```\n        * The above script builds our react frontend project.\n        * flake8 is a python library to check coding styles and warnings including some imported libraries that are unused and undefined names etc.\n        * For information on pytest follow this [link](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/)\n        * Initially pytest will give an error and hence it would be better to comment it. This bug is yet to be fixed.\n        * Commit the file and your CI is ready to go!\n\n> Check for errors in the details section and resolve any that is encountered.\n\n### Continuous Deployment (CD)\n* It is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate any changes and deploys it to the server.\n* Simply put, after CI, it deploys your code to the production environment automatically.\n\n\n> There are two ways to acheive this. One, to accomodate the code in the CI.yml file itself and the other is to create a whole new file for increasing modularity.\n* We have done the second approach.\n* For the first one, copy the build code written above and instead of build (under jobs), write deploy and then write the code as per the below steps.\n\n* Steps\n    * Go to actions tab on the site.\n    * Click create new workflow.\n    * Click on **create a workflow yourself.**\n    * Most of the code remains the same as that in CI.\n    * Under jobs, replace build with deploy.\n    * Delete the **workflow_dispatch** code.\n    * Further, delete the **uses section and single command code** under **steps**.\n    * By now, you will only be left with one multi-line script under **steps**.\n    * Replace the **name** with anything relavant.\n    * Then type the following without any tabs or indentation. **Note that the following should be exactly below name and without a hypen (-)**\n        * uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master\n        * This allows github to \"ssh\" into our server.\n    * Now open a terminal in your **local machine** and type the following command.\n        * ```bash\n            ssh-keygen -C <EMAILID>\n        ```\n        * Make sure to replace <EMAILID> with radio's email ID.\n        * This will create a new public and private key.\n    * Then, go to the settings of the repository.\n    * Left hand side, click on secrets and then click on new repository secret.\n    * Provide your newly created **private key** and name it anything relevant.\n    * Now \"ssh\" into the server and under .ssh/authorized_keys, place the newly created **public key** in it.\n    * Now go back on github site and add the with section shown in the below image. Make sure it is exactly the same except changing the secrets name accoring to what you have added in github secrets.\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-18-19-36.png)\n    * **Make sure that you change the secrets with your respective server.**\n    * With the same indentation as that of host, key etc. write script for deployment.\n    * script: |\n        ```bash\n        cd stepwellradio\n        git pull https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME><REPO_NAME>.git\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install flake8 pytest\n        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\n        cd frontend\n        npm install\n        cd ..\n        cd backend\n        python manage.py collectstatic\n        echo \"Deployed Successfully\"\n        ```\n    * Once it is done, you are good to go.\n    * Check details of guthub actions to make sure that there aren't any errors during the deployment.\n    * Some potential errors\n        * python, pip, nodejs and npm not installed.\n        * So make sure that these are installed on the server.\n        * **Note that these errors are just for first time set up of the server and hence the commands that are needed to install these need not be placed under the scripts.**\n\n> There are certain errors that are yet to be resolved like deploy should happen after build returns exit code 0 and some python virtual environment related issues.\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/U0qOIfpT7EhTQEKw8ZvA4.html","relUrl":"notes/U0qOIfpT7EhTQEKw8ZvA4.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes/changelog.html","relUrl":"notes/changelog.html"}]
