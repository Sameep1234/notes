It would all be automated and done by github actions.\r\n* Steps\r\n    * Go to github actions tab on the site.\r\n    * Click create new workflow.\r\n    * Under the continuous integration workflows, click more  continuous integration workflows.\r\n    * Select the **Python application** and click set up this workflow.\r\n        * name: Self-explanatory\r\n        * on: when do you want to trigger the scripts\r\n        * push: Implies that the scripts will trigger on push\r\n        * branches: On which branch shall the \"event\" (push, pull etc) occur, so as to trigger CI workflow.\r\n        * jobs: **Most important part.**\r\n        * build: We specify whether we are building or deploying (write deploy instead of build to let it know that its a deploy script)\r\n        * runs-on: Remote desktop offered by **github.**\r\n        * steps: Self-explanatory\r\n        * uses: preferable keep it actions/checkout@v2. It implies that we are just building and not deploying. For deploying we will need to \"ssh\" into the server and hence we will need to change this.\r\n        * name: name of the script\r\n        * uses: Since, we selected python, keep it as it is.\r\n        * with: Specify the version, for us it would be a python version.\r\n        * run: Here write the script for building your project\r\n        ```bash\r\n        pip install flake8\r\n        pip install pytest\r\n        cd frontend\r\n        npm install\r\n        npm run build\r\n        ```\r\n        * The above script builds our react frontend project.\r\n        * flake8 is a python library to check coding styles and warnings including some imported libraries that are unused and undefined names etc.\r\n        * For information on pytest follow this [link](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/)\r\n        * Initially pytest will give an error and hence it would be better to comment it. This bug is yet to be fixed.\r\n        * Commit the file and your CI is ready to go!\r\n\r\n> Check for errors in the details section and resolve any that is encountered.\r\n\r\n### Continuous Deployment (CD)\r\n* It is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate any changes and deploys it to the server.\r\n* Simply put, after CI, it deploys your code to the production environment automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n> There are two ways to acheive this. One, to accomodate the code in the CI.yml file itself and the other is to create a whole new file for increasing modularity.\r\n* We have done the second approach.\r\n* For the first one, copy the build code written above and instead of build (under jobs), write deploy and then write the code as per the below steps.\r\n\r\n* Steps\r\n    * Go to actions tab on the site.\r\n    * Click create new workflow.\r\n    * Click on **create a workflow yourself.**\r\n    * Most of the code remains the same as that in CI.\r\n    * Under jobs, replace build with deploy.\r\n    * Delete the **workflow_dispatch** code.\r\n    * Further, delete the **uses section and single command code** under **steps**.\r\n    * By now, you will only be left with one multi-line script under **steps**.\r\n    * Replace the **name** with anything relavant.\r\n    * Then type the following without any tabs or indentation. **Note that the following should be exactly below name and without a hypen (-)**\r\n        * uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master\r\n        * This allows github to \"ssh\" into our server.\r\n    * Now open a terminal in your **local machine** and type the following command.\r\n        * ```bash\r\n            ssh-keygen -C <EMAILID>\r\n        ```\r\n        * Make sure to replace <EMAILID> with radio's email ID.\r\n        * This will create a new public and private key.\r\n    * Then, go to the settings of the repository.\r\n    * Left hand side, click on secrets and then click on new repository secret.\r\n    * Provide your newly created **private key** and name it anything relevant.\r\n    * Now \"ssh\" into the server and under .ssh/authorized_keys, place the newly created **public key** in it.\r\n    * Now go back on github site and add the with section shown in the below image. Make sure it is exactly the same except changing the secrets name accoring to what you have added in github secrets.\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-18-19-36.png)\r\n    * **Make sure that you change the secrets with your respective server.**\r\n    * With the same indentation as that of host, key etc. write script for deployment.\r\n    * script: |\r\n        ```bash\r\n        cd stepwellradio\r\n        git pull https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME><REPO_NAME>.git\r\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\r\n        pip install flake8 pytest\r\n        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\r\n        cd frontend\r\n        npm install\r\n        cd ..\r\n        cd backend\r\n        python manage.py collectstatic\r\n        echo \"Deployed Successfully\"\r\n        ```\r\n    * Once it is done, you are good to go.\r\n    * Check details of guthub actions to make sure that there aren't any errors during the deployment.\r\n    * Some potential errors\r\n        * python, pip, nodejs and npm not installed.\r\n        * So make sure that these are installed on the server.\r\n        * **Note that these errors are just for first time set up of the server and hence the commands that are needed to install these need not be placed under the scripts.**\r\n\r\n> There are certain errors that are yet to be resolved like deploy should happen after build returns exit code 0 and some python virtual environment related issues.\r\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\3FLsdp7cHrFpp80a3luTz.html","relUrl":"notes\\3FLsdp7cHrFpp80a3luTz.html"},{"doc":"Hack","title":"Hack","hpath":"hack","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\tf4EZkjy7pO0PyBoTTUm1.html","relUrl":"notes\\tf4EZkjy7pO0PyBoTTUm1.html"},{"doc":"Courses","title":"Courses","hpath":"hack.courses","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\cDYirVmosOl7x1zb9SKI7.html","relUrl":"notes\\cDYirVmosOl7x1zb9SKI7.html"},{"doc":"Sem5","title":"Sem5","hpath":"hack.courses.sem5","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\TB9izHRgRr5T48DXg123c.html","relUrl":"notes\\TB9izHRgRr5T48DXg123c.html"},{"doc":"Mus","title":"Mus","hpath":"hack.courses.sem5.mus","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\GrG8STxtjZuSrIy3KZ8le.html","relUrl":"notes\\GrG8STxtjZuSrIy3KZ8le.html"},{"doc":"Guestspeaker","title":"Guestspeaker","hpath":"hack.courses.sem5.mus.guestspeaker","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\xfSEoNEXUCTv7xatHC10M.html","relUrl":"notes\\xfSEoNEXUCTv7xatHC10M.html"},{"doc":"Viveickrajgopalan","title":"Viveickrajgopalan","hpath":"hack.courses.sem5.mus.guestspeaker.viveickrajgopalan","content":"","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\xtJFhTbkaAgI14u5GmXM1.html","relUrl":"notes\\xtJFhTbkaAgI14u5GmXM1.html"},{"doc":"Viveickrajgopalan","title":"Viveickrajgopalan","hpath":"hack.courses.sem5.mus.guestspeaker.viveickrajgopalan.md","content":"## What do you see when you look yourself in the mirror? \n\n* The distance between 2 earlobes of every human is the same \n* Science is important for studying music because it deals with Human emotions \n* When you are driving a vehicle: You need to know all the variables  \n* Errors are inevitable, so is the recognition of that error if you want to achieve mastery \n\n## Start of Ta Dhom\n* We usually focus on literacy and not education \n* The first way to learn anything is to copy (something that is engrained in humans) \n* Ta Dhom was the inspiration to India 91 \n* We trained for 2 hours a day for 8 months  \n* Then came the realization that anyone can learn this language \n\n## Basic structures\n* Ta Ka Dhi Mi \n   * The clap on it's own does not have any measure\n   * _Ta Ka Dhi Mi_ are like the four dots \n   * It gives it a tempo or a measure\n* 4+3+4+5 = 16 beats\n  * Ta Ka Ta Ki Ta\n  * Ta Ki Ta \n  * Ta Ka Dhi Mi \n\n## Yatis and Formulae\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-17-59-25.png)\n* Formless is not chaos, it is beautiful \n* What is forecoming looks narrow, what is behind looks widened in Yatis\n* Everything in Yatis is an opposite of another\n\n> \"Say it with me\" - Vivieck Rajgopalan  \n\n# QnA \n## Does the movie industry dilute the richness of the rap that comes through? \n* Any film has been reflective of the society \n* A filmmaker can only do justice to what he/she is inspired by \n* Rap as a culture is something about representing a voice; similar to folk \n  * Non conformist approach is unique to rap \n* Don't copy - People listen to the flow and not your words \n\n## Ta and Dhom analogy?

To acheive the same, we need to attach the strain guage in such a fashion that the value of R3 decreases.\r\n* Only if R3 decreases will the drop increase.\r\n* Now to further increase the sensitivity, we use strain guage in place of R1 and R2 also.\r\n* The manner of attaching the strain guage gets reversed because we want to decrease the value of R1 to increase the value of potential drop.\r\n* Types of bridges\r\n    * Quater - Only one strain guage is used.\r\n    * Half - Two strain guages are used.\r\n    * Full - Four starain guages are used.\r\n* Note that we should use the same/identical strain guages for (R4, R3) pair and (R1, R2) because the strain resistance is a function of temperature also and we want the conditions to be almost similar for both the strain guages.\r\n* This is also the reason as to why three strain guages are not used in a bridge.

For this, the feedback has to be electrical.\r\n        * This means that the control action depends on the output variable.\r\n    * There are various other factors which can't be known and hence are assumed to be constant. For example, ageing and changes in load weight. \r\n    * The main difference between open loop and close loop system is of feedback which is not present in open loop system.\r\n\r\n## Steady state calculation\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-20-17.png)\r\n* A is the gain of the amplifier. It is dimensionless. Also called as the loop gain.\r\n* Km is the motor constant. Upto Km, we will get the **speed** of the motor.\r\n* Ks is the sensor constant. Speed sensors input is speed and output is voltage. Dimension of Ks is opposite tso that of Km. Ks = $\\frac{Vf}{N}$.\r\n* N = speed in rpm.\r\n* A*Km*Ks is called the loop gain of the system. So larger its value, the smaller is the difference and hence we get almost equal value to Vs.\r\n* So it is better to obtain loop gain of 100 and it is achievable.\r\n\r\n## Specification of control systems\r\n* Accuracy of output in steady state.\r\n* Speed of response.\r\n* Feedback (Improves both).\r\n    * Because of this, the effective time constant is reduced and hence speed and accuracy is improved.\r\n\r\n## Steps in analysis of control system\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-49-06.png)\r\n\r\n## Example of Oven\r\n* Block Diagram\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-39-38.png)\r\n* The rate of increase depends on thermal resistance and thermal capacitance.\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-42-28.png)\r\n* Heat flow is in watts.

This might take time which is greater than the allocated one.\r\n* So in the middle of the execution of a process, dispatcher stops the execution and decides which process should go next.\r\n* Once decided, either execution of new process starts or execution of old process continues.\r\n* Then, suppose there is an I/O request. Since this is a slow operation, the dispatcher will allow another process to run on the processor.\r\n* This goes on and on untill all the processes are executed.\r\n\r\n> The above method is from **processor POV** and is called **interleaving of processes** and the OS manages this through **dispatcher**.

Since there are two types of processes, one who did not terminate but their allocated time got over and others who are waiting for I/O or other resouces.\r\n* This, in turn is the 5-state process model.\r\n* Total states in this model\r\n    * New - Process that has just been created but not admitted to the pool of the ready state processes.\r\n        * **Not loaded in main memory but is created.**\r\n        * This means that PCB for that process has been created but its corresponding data and program has not been loaded/created in the main memory.\r\n    * Ready\r\n    * Blocked/Waiting\r\n    * Running\r\n    * Exit (Earlier it was not a state but now it is) - Process which has been released from the pool of processes.\r\n        * However, there is some part of PCB left in main memory for accounting.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-32-07.png)\r\n\r\n## State Transitions\r\n\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-36-29.png)\r\n\r\n* Ready and Blocked process can enter directly to exit state when its parent process has terminated or the process is terminated by the OS.\r\n* When process spawning occurs, then child process is created in the new state.\r\n* Hang state is equivalent to blocked/waiting state.\r\n\r\n## Multiple Blocked Queue\r\n* Suppose there are 10 processes which are in blocked queue waiting for HDD to get accesible and there are 90 processes that are in hang mode.\r\n* Now once HDD is ready to be accessed, OS will have to search this blocked queue and move all these processes to ready state.\r\n* This is again time consuming and complex.

It gains control from monitor to execute the task and once completed returns the control to monitor.\r\n\r\n> JCL (Job control language) - It is a programming language that provides instruction to the monitor about the compiler and data to be used.\r\n\r\n* Modes of operation\r\n    * User mode (Analogy: Normal Mode) - Programs submitted by the user to the memory are executed in this mode. **Not all instructions may be executed.**\r\n    * Kernal mode (Analogy: Admin Mode) - Part of a modern OS that actually performs I/O Management, Process Management etc. Nowadays, we have many other utility programs running which are a part of OS, but kernal is the most important one which manages the above mentioned things.\r\n\r\n* Issues\r\n    * Processor remains idle.\r\n    * Slow compared to processor even with automatic job sequence.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-23-38-27.png)\r\n\r\n## Uniprogramming\r\n\r\n> Processor must wait for I/O instruction to complete before proceeding further.\r\n\r\n## Multiprogramming\r\n\r\n> Opposite of uniprogramming. Still there will be some waiting time but at least it can be reduced and hence is better than uniprogramming.\r\n\r\n## Time sharing systems\r\n* The program is being shared through different users and different monitors. Thus, can be used to handle multiple interactive jobs.\r\n* Processor time is shared among multiple users.\r\n* This time is in milli or micro seconds. This is called short burst or quantum of computation.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-00-06-36.png)\r\n\r\n## OS Structure\r\n* *For general purpose OS, the program is very large.*\r\n* Ways to structure OS\r\n    * Monolitic Approach (Analofy coding in C where there are no classes) - Everything combined in one place.\r\n        * Eg. Older LINUX and UNIX\r\n        * Advantages\r\n            * Speed as everything is connected\r\n            * Performance\r\n        * Disadvantages\r\n            * Difficult to maintain and modify\r\n    * Layered Approach - OS divided into number of layers.\r\n        * Layer 0 = hardware and Layer n = user interface layer\r\n        * A particular layer can use functions and services of **lower-level layers only (layers below it).**\r\n        * Eg. Older windows versions\r\n    * Microkernels - Move as much functionalities as possible to user mode from kernel mode. \r\n        * Unlike that in layered and monolithic where majority of the functionalities is available in only kernal mode.\r\n        * I\\O and interrupt management, primitive memory management, inter-process communication and basic scheduling were kept in kernel mode.\r\n        * All other functionalities will be running in user mode.\r\n        * Advantages\r\n            * Time is reduced significantly as the time to change the mode from user to kernel and vice versa is almost completely diminished.\r\n            * Porting of OS to newer architecture becomes easier (will be covered in upcoming lectures).\r\n            * More reliable because less code is running in kernel mode.\r\n            * More secure as less code has to be valudated in kernel.\r\n        * Disadvantages\r\n            * Performance overhead to change the mode.\r\n        * Eg. Mach, MINIX, Windows NT Client-Server\r\n    * Modules - Most moedern OS implement kernel modules\r\n        * These are loadable kernel module\r\n        * Uses OOP\r\n        * Similar to layers but is more flexible\r\n        * Eg. Device Drivers (These are loaded as needed within the kernel)\r\n        * Solaris Modular Approach (will be covered in upcoming lectures).\r\n    * Hybrid Approach - Combines multiple approaches to address performance, security and usability.\r\n        * Eg. Linux and Solaris = monolithich + modular, windows = monolithic + microkernel and Mac OS and IOS = Darwin which is microkernel and BSD Unix kernel implemented over layered model\r\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\DuyqCiM0madNn92jbmrbQ.html","relUrl":"notes\\DuyqCiM0madNn92jbmrbQ.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 14","title":"Lecture 14","hpath":"courses.Semester

exclusion.\r\n* Attempt 1\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-19-32.png)\r\n    * Suppose process 0 needs to enter into critical section every hour and process 1 needs to enter the critical section 1000 times in an hour.\r\n    * Now, it is suppose process 0 exits the critical section and allows process 1 to enter.\r\n    * turn variable is set 0 for the next 1 hour because process 0 is not going to go in the critical section.\r\n    * This means that process 1 will suffer.\r\n    * Secondly, if one process fails, the other process is permanently blocked.\r\n* Attempt 2\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-24-37.png)\r\n    * In this attempt, we continuously check the flag of other process and if it is false, then only enter the critical section.\r\n    * Furthermore, lock the critical section by toggling the flag and once the process leaves the critical section, toggle the flag to free the critical section for other processes.\r\n    * Lets say process 0 gets switched after executing the first line.\r\n    * The problem is obvious then. **We can't acheive mutual exclusion.**\r\n* Attempt 3\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-42-42.png)\r\n    * Deadlock situation can arrise if one instruction per process is executed.\r\n* Attempt 4\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-46-03.png)\r\n    * Livelock situation can arrise if delay are same because both will check at the same time.\r\n    * Similar situation can arrise if one instruction is executed at a time.\r\n\r\n## Dekker's Algorithm\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-49-52.png)\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-50-05.png)\r\n* Each process first says that I want to enter with turning flag = true.\r\n* Then it checks other processes and whether they are in the critical section or not by checking flag as well as turn variables.\r\n* Then waits if both are true and vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Peterson's Algorithm\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-23-53-55.png)\r\n* It is reduced and less complex then dekker's algorithm.\r\n* Correctness\r\n    *

Electron affinity is energy gained by putting an electron in (from vacuum) and by convention it is negative.\r\n\r\n> Electronegativity is the measure of how likely an atom will take up or give up an electron.\r\n\r\n* Valence electrons determine the physical properties viz chemical, electrical, thermal and optical\r\n* Electropositive elements easily give up electrons to become positive ions. These generally rest in the left sife of the periodic table and vice versa for electronegative elements.\r\n* This means electronegativity is smaller on left side and larger on the right side.\r\n\r\n## Physical properties in Periodic table\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-08-27.png)\r\n\r\n## Bonding in solids\r\n* At large distances, interactions are negligible and at small distances each atom exerts forces on the other.\r\n* These include, force of attraction and that of repulsion.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-12-56.png)\r\n\r\n* Fnet = Fr + Fa.

This means that it is the energy required to seperate two atoms to an infinite seperation.\r\n* It the curve above is deep, this implies that the material is rigid and inflexible and vice versa.\r\n* If the double derivative of the energy (equivalent to single derivative of force equation) equation at r = r0 is less than 0 then it is stable and vice versa.\r\n* To find the equalibrium position, make the single derivative of the energy equation (equivalent to the force equation) equal to 0.\r\n* The mechanical stiffness (elasticity) of a material is dependent on the shapr of its F vs r diagram.\r\n* Steep curve means relatively stiff and vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Ionic Bonding\r\n* Generally takes place between metals and non-metals. There is a complete transfer of electron.\r\n* **Difference between electronegativity is of prime importance. Ionic bonding only occurs between atoms with large differences in electronegativity.**\r\n* Cation = Positive Ion, Anion = Negative Ion\r\n* Primary Bonding means that electrons are completely transferred. Atoms do so to acheive stable configuration. Such type of bonding is very strong (columbic force in case of ionic bonding). (Eg. Ionic, Covalent and Metallic)\r\n* Ionic bonds are non-directional whereas covalent bonds are directional in nature. **Non-directional means that the magnitude of bond is equal in all directions around an ion.**\r\n* Secondary Bonding means that electrons are shared. This type of bonding is weaker compared to primary bonding. (Eg. inert gases (H2, Cl2) or permanet dipoles (H20, HCl))\r\n* Enet (due to all attractions and repulsions) is known as **madelung energy**.\r\n* The predominant bonding in **ceramic materials** is **ionic.**\r\n\r\n## Covalent Bonding\r\n* **Covalent bonding occurs between atoms with small differences in electronegativity.**\r\n* The stable electroninc configuration is achieved by **sharing of electrons**.\r\n* Generally occur between non-metals and is directional bond.\r\n* Number of colvalent bonds is determined by the number of valence electrons.\r\n* Percent of ionic characters:\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-46-57.png)\r\n\r\n* Here Xa and Xb are the electronegativities of elements a and b. Greater the difference between electronegativities, greater is the ionic bonding and vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Metallic Bonding\r\n* Found in metals and their alloys.\r\n* According to the model presented, the valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom in the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal.\r\n* Thus, these are called as electron clound as the electrons are all over the metal.\r\n* The remaining non-valence electrons and nucleus form the ion core and **posses a net positive charge** equal to total valence electrons charge per atom.\r\n* The free electrons sheild the positively charged ion cores from mutually repulsive electrostatic forces along with acting as a **glue**.\r\n* Because of the availability of free electrons, metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity.\r\n\r\n## Van der waals bodning\r\n* All the above mentioned bonds are **primary** bonds and this type of bond is **secondary** in nature.\r\n* It is weaker as compared to primary bonds.\r\n* It is virtually ubiquitous but presence of primary bonds diminishes their effect.\r\n* Usually found between **inert gases**.\r\n* Dipoles are formed which exists whenever there is some separation of positive and negative portions of an atom or molecule.\r\n* Hydrogen bonding is a special type of secondary bonding that exists metweeb some molecules that have hydrogen as one of its constituents.\r\n\r\n## Summary of Bonding\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-50-27.png)\r\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\1aLcWNPDgNX5qkq9mIfSm.html","relUrl":"notes\\1aLcWNPDgNX5qkq9mIfSm.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering.Lecture 1","content":"\n\r\n# Introduction to Material Science and Engineering\r\n\r\n## Points to Ponder\r\n* With slight change in physical properties, we can get a whole new material.

After multiple iterations a child knows that when a telephone rings, we pick it up and talk. Similar is the case with wireless mobile phones but the range is low in wired case.\r\n* Thus, identifying the scheme is of prime importance. So, for the telephone example, the scheme is that whenever it rings, someone comes and picks it up.\r\n* Now, the new experience is of mobile phones. What to do when it rings?

Clay\r\n* Four stages\r\n    * **Sensorimotor stage** (birth to 2 yrs) \r\n        * Focus on present object and not on the object that is not there.\r\n        * They have basic schmes of shaking, twisting, pushing etc. (inbuilt)\r\n    * **Preoperational stage** (2 to 7 years)\r\n        * Think about the objects that are not present.\r\n        * Don't think of reversible consequence of actions.\r\n        * Use perception rather than logic.\r\n        * Eg. Water in different shapes of container.\r\n    * **Concrete-Operational stage** (7 to 11 yrs)\r\n        * These are tied to their actual experiences.\r\n        * Eg.

It is the volume of the room.\r\n\r\n## Vigotsky's Theory\r\n* Its main principle is that children develop in the social world by interacting with other people and products of their cultural history.\r\n* Eg. Child born in a tribe and in a modern family.\r\n    * The difference between learning language in modern family and that in tribe would be of written documentation.\r\n    * Tribe people might not have a written manuscript of the symbols and language that they use whereas modern family have perfectly well maintained documentation of the rules and regulations of their language.\r\n    * Thus, a child in tribe might learn about only the spoken part and not the written part whearas in modern family, a child learns both.\r\n* Social elements\r\n    * Symbols\r\n    * Knowledge\r\n    * Ideas\r\n    * Mode of reasoning\r\n\r\n## Difference in perspective of both theories\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-11-44-22.png)\r\n* In the above example, from piaget's perspective, the child discovered the rule of commutativity because the child acted on the pebbles (physical environment) and while playing with it.\r\n* From the vigotsky's perspective, the child belongs to the community where they know how to count or at least that community value counting because of which the child started counting.\r\n* Otherwise, the child could have done numerous other activities with the pebbles like throwing it, catching it etc.\r\n* This also means that the community also has some symbols that facilitate counting.

This immense heating causing chemically binded water to detach from the clay making it very hard.\r\n* **Note that the temperature when firing the clay should be raised slowly and not drastically.**\r\n* This is because clay is porous and when firing, chemically bonded water will try to escape. Now, if suddenly the temperature is raised then the chemically bonded water will not escape suddenly.\r\n* Instead, the silica fuses into one another trapping the chemically bonded water.\r\n* Now, at high temperatures, these chemically bonded water turns into steam creating air bubbles.\r\n* As a result, the clay will disintegrate immediately. Same applies for cooling too. You have to cool the clay very slowly.\r\n\r\n## Colors of material at different temperature\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-10.png)\r\n\r\n## Quartz Inversion Temperature\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-43.png)\r\n* Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2) and has a trigonal crystalline structure called as alpha-quartz.\r\n* At 573 degrees it gets converted into beta-quartz which is hexagonal in shape.\r\n* So now, it holds clay at 6 points unlike earlier where it holded clay at only 3 points.\r\n* Now, because of this beta-quartz, the properties of silica change and thus, becomes impervious to water damage.\r\n* Now, if we cool the clay as soon as it reached 573 degrees, only some part of clay will get converted and majority will disintegrate as soon as it comes in contact of water.\r\n* Therfore, it is of vital importance that we keep the clay at least equal to 573 degrees for about 2-3 hrs. It depends on how big is the pot.\r\n* Finally, after quartz inversion takes place, clay turns into ceramics.\r\n\r\n## Sintering\r\n* This is the next phase of clay firing starting at 900 degrees.\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-33-49.png)\r\n* **After this phase, the water will be retained because of fusion of clay particles.**\r\n* Pores get removed due to exertion of pressure on each silica particle.\r\n* This process is called **solid phase sintering.**\r\n\r\n## Vitrification\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-41-09.png)\r\n* After solid phase sintering, there might be some pores that are still left which may allow water to pass.\r\n* Thus, this next phase is crucial to cover all the pores.\r\n* In order to lower the melting point of silica, flux is added.\r\n* Flux is **glassy** in nature. In fact, vitri means glass case.\r\n* Flux are oxides of metals like calcium, sodian, magnesium, lead, potassion, manganese etc.\r\n* Now, these oxides (in power form) melt at 1600 degrees and form a liquid.\r\n* This liquid flows into the pores and solidifies there making the clay fully impervious.\r\n* This process is called **liquid phase sintering.**\r\n* **Here, note that silica particles are not melting. It is the flux that is melting.**\r\n\r\n## Glazing\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-52-17.png)\r\n* It beautifies clay by giving it a feel of glass.\r\n* **Vitreous means glassy.**\r\n\r\n## Summary of stages of clay\r\n* Quartz inversion\r\n* Solid phase sintering\r\n* Liquid phase sintering (vitrification).\r\n* This turns clay to ceramics.\r\n* Glaze\r\n\r\n## Extra Points\r\n* Melting point of silica = 2000 degress.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Wood\r\n* This is an organic material and is found in nature.\r\n* Made from cellulose and bio-organisms can decay these materials.\r\n* Carving would be easier on wood rather than that on stone because wood is way more softer than stone.\r\n* Wood is higly porous.\r\n\r\n## Surfaces of wood\r\n* Inlay\r\n    * Insertion of stone by making a fine cut in the wood.\r\n* Paint\r\n* Varnish\r\n* Gilded\r\n    * Gold leaf is applied with plaster like substance (to provide adhesiveness to gold leaf) to give wood a appearance of metal.\r\n* Lacquer\r\n    * Dip the material in lac which develop aesthetic cracks.\r\n\r\n## Important timbers\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-01.png)\r\n\r\n## Types of wood\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-47.png)\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-11-49.png)\r\n\r\n## Components of wood\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-12-21.png)\r\n* If all the water is lost from the wood, then the wood would shrink and vice versa.\r\n* The exansion and contraction takes place in wood to a great extent.

Thus, we can say that the non-metallic quality of metal increases.\r\n* **Magnetic effect** is used to detect how much **core metal** is left and how much **rust** is formed.\r\n\r\n## Electrochemical Series\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-22-24-30.png)\r\n* The metals here are placed according to their decreasing reactivity. Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.\r\n* Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.\r\n* It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.\r\n* Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations.

Two types include anode and cathode.\r\n* Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.\r\n* Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.\r\n* Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.\r\n* This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.\r\n* So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.\r\n* **To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.**\r\n* Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.\r\n* Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection.

It is a surface phenomena.\r\n* Silver sulfide layer is called as noble patina because it is non reactive.\r\n* Oxide layer on broze is blackish in color or called as blackish patina.\r\n* Cuprous oxide layer is brownish in color and later it will change to cupric oxide which is more stable and is blackish in color.\r\n\r\n## Types of oxide\r\n* Unstable metal oxide - Gold, Silver and Platinum\r\n* Stable metal oxide - Copper, Tin and Lead\r\n* Volatile metal oxide - Molebdenum\r\n* Porous metal oxide - Sodium, Potassium, Manganese and iron.\r\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\4gfzYPUYc62svMT1nlhT5.html","relUrl":"notes\\4gfzYPUYc62svMT1nlhT5.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 3","title":"Lecture 3","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 3","content":"\n\r\n# Hardness of Stones and Introduction to metals\r\n\r\n## Mohs Hardness Scale\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-14-42-38.png)\r\n* Gypsum\r\n    * Used as one of the raw components of cement and its called calcium sulphate.\r\n    * It is really soft.\r\n* Calcite\r\n    * Chief component of limestone and marble.\r\n    * It is called Calcium Carbonate\r\n* Quartz\r\n    * It is very hard.\r\n    * Used in sandstone and granite\r\n    * Hence, these materials are also hard.\r\n    * It is called silicon dioxide.\r\n    * Harder than Gypsum and Calcite as evident from the above figure.\r\n    * Artifacts of sandstone have different colors like shown in below image.\r\n        * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-05-34.png)\r\n    * This means that if **iron content** is more, then it **gives red** color and if **clay content** is more, then it **gives yellow** color.\r\n    * The red color of the red fort is red because of ferruginous sandstone.

It has dedicated 1-bit to store every flag that we may encounter.\r\n\r\n## TIFR Circuit\r\n* It is an 8-bit register.\r\n* Stores flags and **overflow flag is set on 0th bit**.\r\n* Value \"1\" implies overflowed and vice versa.\r\n> The below given figure will be provided for reference in exam.\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-37-11.png)\r\n\r\n* Prescalers slows down the clock. Hence increases the time period.\r\n* Thus, multiply the prescaler to clock time period to get the adequate delay.\r\n* Overflow flag is located on 0th bit. Hence to check overflow we check TIFR & 0x1 to be 0.\r\n* **Make sure that to reset the flag by putting \"1\" to the flag.**\r\n* The reason for this could be understood using an analogy. These are not the direct registers. These like control registers which means they act as a switch. We are pressing the \"reset\" switch (by putting \"1\") and in turn it is telling the actual register to reset the values. Thus, instead of 0, we are passing 1.\r\n* Example questions\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-40-28.png)\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-11-42-27.png)\r\n    * Toggle bits on 4th Pin of PORTB continuously with delay of 70 microseconds.
