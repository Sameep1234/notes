It would all be automated and done by github actions.\r\n* Steps\r\n    * Go to github actions tab on the site.\r\n    * Click create new workflow.\r\n    * Under the continuous integration workflows, click more  continuous integration workflows.\r\n    * Select the **Python application** and click set up this workflow.\r\n        * name: Self-explanatory\r\n        * on: when do you want to trigger the scripts\r\n        * push: Implies that the scripts will trigger on push\r\n        * branches: On which branch shall the \"event\" (push, pull etc) occur, so as to trigger CI workflow.\r\n        * jobs: **Most important part.**\r\n        * build: We specify whether we are building or deploying (write deploy instead of build to let it know that its a deploy script)\r\n        * runs-on: Remote desktop offered by **github.**\r\n        * steps: Self-explanatory\r\n        * uses: preferable keep it actions/checkout@v2. It implies that we are just building and not deploying. For deploying we will need to \"ssh\" into the server and hence we will need to change this.\r\n        * name: name of the script\r\n        * uses: Since, we selected python, keep it as it is.\r\n        * with: Specify the version, for us it would be a python version.\r\n        * run: Here write the script for building your project\r\n        ```bash\r\n        pip install flake8\r\n        pip install pytest\r\n        cd frontend\r\n        npm install\r\n        npm run build\r\n        ```\r\n        * The above script builds our react frontend project.\r\n        * flake8 is a python library to check coding styles and warnings including some imported libraries that are unused and undefined names etc.\r\n        * For information on pytest follow this [link](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/)\r\n        * Initially pytest will give an error and hence it would be better to comment it. This bug is yet to be fixed.\r\n        * Commit the file and your CI is ready to go!\r\n\r\n> Check for errors in the details section and resolve any that is encountered.\r\n\r\n### Continuous Deployment (CD)\r\n* It is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate any changes and deploys it to the server.\r\n* Simply put, after CI, it deploys your code to the production environment automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n> There are two ways to acheive this. One, to accomodate the code in the CI.yml file itself and the other is to create a whole new file for increasing modularity.\r\n* We have done the second approach.\r\n* For the first one, copy the build code written above and instead of build (under jobs), write deploy and then write the code as per the below steps.\r\n\r\n* Steps\r\n    * Go to actions tab on the site.\r\n    * Click create new workflow.\r\n    * Click on **create a workflow yourself.**\r\n    * Most of the code remains the same as that in CI.\r\n    * Under jobs, replace build with deploy.\r\n    * Delete the **workflow_dispatch** code.\r\n    * Further, delete the **uses section and single command code** under **steps**.\r\n    * By now, you will only be left with one multi-line script under **steps**.\r\n    * Replace the **name** with anything relavant.\r\n    * Then type the following without any tabs or indentation. **Note that the following should be exactly below name and without a hypen (-)**\r\n        * uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master\r\n        * This allows github to \"ssh\" into our server.\r\n    * Now open a terminal in your **local machine** and type the following command.\r\n        * ```bash\r\n            ssh-keygen -C <EMAILID>\r\n        ```\r\n        * Make sure to replace <EMAILID> with radio's email ID.\r\n        * This will create a new public and private key.\r\n    * Then, go to the settings of the repository.\r\n    * Left hand side, click on secrets and then click on new repository secret.\r\n    * Provide your newly created **private key** and name it anything relevant.\r\n    * Now \"ssh\" into the server and under .ssh/authorized_keys, place the newly created **public key** in it.\r\n    * Now go back on github site and add the with section shown in the below image. Make sure it is exactly the same except changing the secrets name accoring to what you have added in github secrets.\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-18-19-36.png)\r\n    * **Make sure that you change the secrets with your respective server.**\r\n    * With the same indentation as that of host, key etc. write script for deployment.\r\n    * script: |\r\n        ```bash\r\n        cd stepwellradio\r\n        git pull https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME><REPO_NAME>.git\r\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\r\n        pip install flake8 pytest\r\n        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\r\n        cd frontend\r\n        npm install\r\n        cd ..\r\n        cd backend\r\n        python manage.py collectstatic\r\n        echo \"Deployed Successfully\"\r\n        ```\r\n    * Once it is done, you are good to go.\r\n    * Check details of guthub actions to make sure that there aren't any errors during the deployment.\r\n    * Some potential errors\r\n        * python, pip, nodejs and npm not installed.\r\n        * So make sure that these are installed on the server.\r\n        * **Note that these errors are just for first time set up of the server and hence the commands that are needed to install these need not be placed under the scripts.**\r\n\r\n> There are certain errors that are yet to be resolved like deploy should happen after build returns exit code 0 and some python virtual environment related issues.\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\3FLsdp7cHrFpp80a3luTz.html","relUrl":"notes\\3FLsdp7cHrFpp80a3luTz.html"},{"doc":"Courses","title":"Courses","hpath":"courses","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\Jq5ki9jf1QLTdc3DYLRW4.html","relUrl":"notes\\Jq5ki9jf1QLTdc3DYLRW4.html"},{"doc":"Semester 5","title":"Semester 5","hpath":"courses.Semester 5","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\O93aKwUCEnkxTR7S8V2eZ.html","relUrl":"notes\\O93aKwUCEnkxTR7S8V2eZ.html"},{"doc":"Sensors","title":"Sensors","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\BU8smu6Xa4e3tkB0iVHT9.html","relUrl":"notes\\BU8smu6Xa4e3tkB0iVHT9.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 9","title":"Lecture 9","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 9","content":"\n> This lecture was donated to a practice quiz and nothing new was taught.

To acheive the same, we need to attach the strain guage in such a fashion that the value of R3 decreases.\n* Only if R3 decreases will the drop increase.\n* Now to further increase the sensitivity, we use strain guage in place of R1 and R2 also.\n* The manner of attaching the strain guage gets reversed because we want to decrease the value of R1 to increase the value of potential drop.\n* Types of bridges\n    * Quater - Only one strain guage is used.\n    * Half - Two strain guages are used.\n    * Full - Four starain guages are used.\n* Note that we should use the same/identical strain guages for (R4, R3) pair and (R1, R2) because the strain resistance is a function of temperature also and we want the conditions to be almost similar for both the strain guages.\n* This is also the reason as to why three strain guages are not used in a bridge. (This is because we want to acheive temperature independence).\n* It is obvious that full bridge is the best in terms of sensitivity but it is costlier than others.\n\n## Quater Bridge Configuration\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-30-21.png)\n\n## Half Bridge Configuration\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-32-36.png)\n\n## Full Bridge Configuration\n* Bending Strain\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-34-20.png)\n* Axial Strain\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-35-18.png)\n\n## Force Sensing Resistance\n* Conducting foam is pressed and the contact resitance will decrease.\n* This is the method by which we define a relationship with force and resistance.\n* Types\n    * Shunt Mode Force Sensitive Resistor\n        * Foam is only on one side.\n    * Thru Mode force sensitve resistor\n        * Froam is on both the sides.\n\n## Force vs Voltage\n* We are benefitted if the change in resistance is somehow reflected by the change in voltage.\n* To achieve this, we use the below given circuit.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-45-49.png)\n* Make sure to select R1 as 1k unless specified otherwise.\n\n## Force Alarm\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-16-47-54.png)\n* Vref depends on problem and hence it is not fix that the value of Vref must be 4V.\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\LbDKJD0pB7bkoOR3RWvtL.html","relUrl":"notes\\LbDKJD0pB7bkoOR3RWvtL.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 7","title":"Lecture 7","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 7","content":"\n# Stress and strain\n\n## Hook's Law\n* Amount of deformation is proportional to the force applies to any object.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-09-41-24.png)\n* F = k*(Change in length)\n* **Note that the force should be small for the relationship to be linear.**\n* If force greater than the threshold is applied than the relationship is not linear.\n* Elstic region corresponds to the range of force where the object will retain its shape.\n\n## Axial vs Transverse force\n* This is called tensile force.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-09-45-18.png)\n* Transverse strain means along the length of the object at perpendicular angle.\n\n## Compressive Force\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-09-48-42.png)\n* $\\frac{F}{A}$ is called stress or pressure.\n* Units of young's modulus is same as stress or pressure i.e N/m*2 or Pascal (Pa).\n\n## Strain Gauge\n* Sensor for measuring strain\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-07-40.png)\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-10-23.png)\n* Now to calculate change in resistance, we measure the change in current or change in voltage and indirectly find change in resistance.\n* $\\frac{Change in R}{R}$ is very small and adding \"1\" might just lead to nothing.\n* To avoid this, we need to set a circuit such that the voltage across the resistor is linearly proportional to $\\frac{Change in R}{R}$.\n* We need a wheatstone bridge to get the linear proportionality.\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-16-43.png)\n* **Understand the equation formed.**\n* Bridge circuit for strain measurment\n    * In the above figure, R4 is the strain gauge whereas others are normal resistors which are all equal.\n    * In bending strain or a tensile strain, the formula still remains the same becuase in either of the cases, the length of the resistor in the strain gauge will change and hence, resitance will change.\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-22-11.png)\n    * Final Equation\n        * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-10-24-07.png)\n    * **Note that the strain will always be positive.** According to the equation the negative value might change as change in voltage (Vo) might be negative if R4 gets too high.\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\QYvF9K1IRAtE3LVihayMy.html","relUrl":"notes\\QYvF9K1IRAtE3LVihayMy.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 6","title":"Lecture 6","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Sensors.Lecture 6","content":"\n## Feedback control\n* Here we are considering the example of an engine of the car.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-03-09-49-46.png)\n* Motor is used for getting a particular position and not a particular speed.\n* Particular position will ensure that the desired speed is achieved.\n\n## Pulse Width modulation\n* Width of the pulse determines the average voltage.

It is dimensionless. Also called as the loop gain.\r\n* Km is the motor constant. Upto Km, we will get the **speed** of the motor.\r\n* Ks is the sensor constant. Speed sensors input is speed and output is voltage. Dimension of Ks is opposite tso that of Km. Ks = $\\frac{Vf}{N}$.\r\n* N = speed in rpm.\r\n* A*Km*Ks is called the loop gain of the system. So larger its value, the smaller is the difference and hence we get almost equal value to Vs.\r\n* So it is better to obtain loop gain of 100 and it is achievable.\r\n\r\n## Specification of control systems\r\n* Accuracy of output in steady state.\r\n* Speed of response.\r\n* Feedback (Improves both).\r\n    * Because of this, the effective time constant is reduced and hence speed and accuracy is improved.\r\n\r\n## Steps in analysis of control system\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-02-13-49-06.png)\r\n\r\n## Example of Oven\r\n* Block Diagram\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-39-38.png)\r\n* The rate of increase depends on thermal resistance and thermal capacitance.\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-42-28.png)\r\n* Heat flow is in watts.

In a process execution, there may occur mode switching. \n* Mode switching means switching from user to kernal mode vice versa.\n\n> So why is process gets switched?\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-23-14.png)\n\n* Reasons for switching (Eg.)\n    * Clock interrupt (time slice expired)\n    * I/O Interrupt (an event occured)\n    * Memory fault (trap) - Accessing memory which is not available.\n\n* Mode Switching - When a running process changes its mode from one to other.\n    * While switching the mode, processor state information of PCB is saved (user to kernel) and restored back (kernel to user).\n    * Mode switch, thus becomes the subset of prcess switch.\n    * Thus, process switch will take more time then mode switch.\n* Steps in process switch\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-28-44.png)\n\n> Is OS a process?\n* Basically OS is a code/program which is in between hardware and application that we run.\n* Designs of OS to explain execution of OS\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-33-06.png)\n\n## Different designs\n* Non-process Kernel\n* Execution within User Processes\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-36-42.png)\n* Process-based OS\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-37-48.png)\n    * More like microkernel architecture.\n\n## Process management in UNIX SVR4\n* SVR4 stands for System V Release 4.\n* **Most** of the the OS executes in user process.\n* System processes - Kernel mode only\n* User Processes\n    * User mode to execute user programs and utilities.\n    * Kernel mode to execture instructions that belong to kernel\n* Process with ID 1 = Linux boots and creates a swapper process which in turn creates init process with ID = 1.\n* This init process creates all the process required to run Linux on boot up.\n* init process works only in kernel mode.\n* Some other process that execute only in kernel mode include dispatcher etc.\n* States\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-06-08-47-29.png)\n    * Fork is the system call used to create new process.\n    * Two extra states\n    * Blocking state is called sleep state.\n    * Zombie state means that process is executed but some imformation realted to data structure and all is still saved for accounting purposes.\n    * Here running state is divided into two parts viz user running state and kernel running state.\n    * At a time, a process can be in either user running state or kernel running state but **not both.**\n    * Preempted is almost similar to ready to run in memory state.

This might take time which is greater than the allocated one.\n* So in the middle of the execution of a process, dispatcher stops the execution and decides which process should go next.\n* Once decided, either execution of new process starts or execution of old process continues.\n* Then, suppose there is an I/O request. Since this is a slow operation, the dispatcher will allow another process to run on the processor.\n* This goes on and on untill all the processes are executed.\n\n> The above method is from **processor POV** and is called **interleaving of processes** and the OS manages this through **dispatcher**. From **process POV**, the process gets executed sequencially.\n\n## Process States\n* Two states\n    * Running\n    * Not running\n* Transition from **not running** to **running** state is called **dispatch** and is called **pause** for the opposite scenario.\n* There can be at most only one process in running state at a given instance of time.\n* There are 'n' number of processes in the non-running state.\n* Thus, to manage all these processes, we need **queue** as the data structure.\n\n## Note\n* The below picture lists conditions under which a process can be created or terminated.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-16-50.png)\n\n* Process spawning means event where a process creates a new process.\n\n## 5-State Process Model\n* Conditions when the process which is running will pause and enter in the queue:\n    * Time slot alloted to the process is over.\n    * Made some I/O request which may take time.\n* Now, dispatcher needs to identify which processes are ready to be executed and then dispatch it from the middle of the queue.\n* This process is time consuming and complex.\n* To resolve this, OS must maintain multiple queues. Since there are two types of processes, one who did not terminate but their allocated time got over and others who are waiting for I/O or other resouces.\n* This, in turn is the 5-state process model.\n* Total states in this model\n    * New - Process that has just been created but not admitted to the pool of the ready state processes.\n        * **Not loaded in main memory but is created.**\n        * This means that PCB for that process has been created but its corresponding data and program has not been loaded/created in the main memory.\n    * Ready\n    * Blocked/Waiting\n    * Running\n    * Exit (Earlier it was not a state but now it is) - Process which has been released from the pool of processes.\n        * However, there is some part of PCB left in main memory for accounting.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-32-07.png)\n\n## State Transitions\n\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-08-29-15-36-29.png)\n\n* Ready and Blocked process can enter directly to exit state when its parent process has terminated or the process is terminated by the OS.\n* When process spawning occurs, then child process is created in the new state.\n* Hang state is equivalent to blocked/waiting state.\n\n## Multiple Blocked Queue\n* Suppose there are 10 processes which are in blocked queue waiting for HDD to get accesible and there are 90 processes that are in hang mode.\n* Now once HDD is ready to be accessed, OS will have to search this blocked queue and move all these processes to ready state.\n* This is again time consuming and complex.

It controls the sequence of events. Resident monitor (another name for simple monitor) is software always in memory. It reads in job and gives control to the processor which in turn returns the control back to monitor\r\n\r\n> Processor executes instructions from the memory i.e monitor which resides in the memory. It gains control from monitor to execute the task and once completed returns the control to monitor.\r\n\r\n> JCL (Job control language) - It is a programming language that provides instruction to the monitor about the compiler and data to be used.\r\n\r\n* Modes of operation\r\n    * User mode (Analogy: Normal Mode) - Programs submitted by the user to the memory are executed in this mode. **Not all instructions may be executed.**\r\n    * Kernal mode (Analogy: Admin Mode) - Part of a modern OS that actually performs I/O Management, Process Management etc. Nowadays, we have many other utility programs running which are a part of OS, but kernal is the most important one which manages the above mentioned things.\r\n\r\n* Issues\r\n    * Processor remains idle.\r\n    * Slow compared to processor even with automatic job sequence.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-23-38-27.png)\r\n\r\n## Uniprogramming\r\n\r\n> Processor must wait for I/O instruction to complete before proceeding further.\r\n\r\n## Multiprogramming\r\n\r\n> Opposite of uniprogramming. Still there will be some waiting time but at least it can be reduced and hence is better than uniprogramming.\r\n\r\n## Time sharing systems\r\n* The program is being shared through different users and different monitors. Thus, can be used to handle multiple interactive jobs.\r\n* Processor time is shared among multiple users.\r\n* This time is in milli or micro seconds.

Electron affinity is energy gained by putting an electron in (from vacuum) and by convention it is negative.\r\n\r\n> Electronegativity is the measure of how likely an atom will take up or give up an electron.\r\n\r\n* Valence electrons determine the physical properties viz chemical, electrical, thermal and optical\r\n* Electropositive elements easily give up electrons to become positive ions. These generally rest in the left sife of the periodic table and vice versa for electronegative elements.\r\n* This means electronegativity is smaller on left side and larger on the right side.\r\n\r\n## Physical properties in Periodic table\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-08-27.png)\r\n\r\n## Bonding in solids\r\n* At large distances, interactions are negligible and at small distances each atom exerts forces on the other.\r\n* These include, force of attraction and that of repulsion.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-12-56.png)\r\n\r\n* Fnet = Fr + Fa. At equilibrium Fnet = 0\r\n* Usually the distance between the two atoms at equilibrium position is 0.3nm.\r\n\r\n## Potential Energy\r\n\r\n> **Here potential energy and energy are used interchangebly.**\r\n\r\n* Energy is integration of foice wrt the radius.\r\n* Enet = Ea + Er.\r\n* **Relation between force and energy is that energy is integration of force.**\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-17-07.png)\r\n\r\n* Attraction energy = -A/r and Repulsive energy = B/power(r,n)\r\n* E0 = Bonding energy at minimum distance. This means that it is the energy required to seperate two atoms to an infinite seperation.\r\n* It the curve above is deep, this implies that the material is rigid and inflexible and vice versa.\r\n* If the double derivative of the energy (equivalent to single derivative of force equation) equation at r = r0 is less than 0 then it is stable and vice versa.\r\n* To find the equalibrium position, make the single derivative of the energy equation (equivalent to the force equation) equal to 0.\r\n* The mechanical stiffness (elasticity) of a material is dependent on the shapr of its F vs r diagram.\r\n* Steep curve means relatively stiff and vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Ionic Bonding\r\n* Generally takes place between metals and non-metals. There is a complete transfer of electron.\r\n* **Difference between electronegativity is of prime importance. Ionic bonding only occurs between atoms with large differences in electronegativity.**\r\n* Cation = Positive Ion, Anion = Negative Ion\r\n* Primary Bonding means that electrons are completely transferred. Atoms do so to acheive stable configuration. Such type of bonding is very strong (columbic force in case of ionic bonding). (Eg. Ionic, Covalent and Metallic)\r\n* Ionic bonds are non-directional whereas covalent bonds are directional in nature. **Non-directional means that the magnitude of bond is equal in all directions around an ion.**\r\n* Secondary Bonding means that electrons are shared. This type of bonding is weaker compared to primary bonding. (Eg. inert gases (H2, Cl2) or permanet dipoles (H20, HCl))\r\n* Enet (due to all attractions and repulsions) is known as **madelung energy**.\r\n* The predominant bonding in **ceramic materials** is **ionic.**\r\n\r\n## Covalent Bonding\r\n* **Covalent bonding occurs between atoms with small differences in electronegativity.**\r\n* The stable electroninc configuration is achieved by **sharing of electrons**.\r\n* Generally occur between non-metals and is directional bond.\r\n* Number of colvalent bonds is determined by the number of valence electrons.\r\n* Percent of ionic characters:\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-46-57.png)\r\n\r\n* Here Xa and Xb are the electronegativities of elements a and b. Greater the difference between electronegativities, greater is the ionic bonding and vice versa.\r\n\r\n## Metallic Bonding\r\n* Found in metals and their alloys.\r\n* According to the model presented, the valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom in the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal.\r\n* Thus, these are called as electron clound as the electrons are all over the metal.\r\n* The remaining non-valence electrons and nucleus form the ion core and **posses a net positive charge** equal to total valence electrons charge per atom.\r\n* The free electrons sheild the positively charged ion cores from mutually repulsive electrostatic forces along with acting as a **glue**.\r\n* Because of the availability of free electrons, metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity.\r\n\r\n## Van der waals bodning\r\n* All the above mentioned bonds are **primary** bonds and this type of bond is **secondary** in nature.\r\n* It is weaker as compared to primary bonds.\r\n* It is virtually ubiquitous but presence of primary bonds diminishes their effect.\r\n* Usually found between **inert gases**.\r\n* Dipoles are formed which exists whenever there is some separation of positive and negative portions of an atom or molecule.\r\n* Hydrogen bonding is a special type of secondary bonding that exists metweeb some molecules that have hydrogen as one of its constituents.\r\n\r\n## Summary of Bonding\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-16-50-27.png)\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\1aLcWNPDgNX5qkq9mIfSm.html","relUrl":"notes\\1aLcWNPDgNX5qkq9mIfSm.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Material Science and Engineering.Lecture 1","content":"\n# Introduction to Material Science and Engineering\n\n## Points to Ponder\n* With slight change in physical properties, we can get a whole new material.

After multiple iterations a child knows that when a telephone rings, we pick it up and talk. Similar is the case with wireless mobile phones but the range is low in wired case.\n* Thus, identifying the scheme is of prime importance.

This immense heating causing chemically binded water to detach from the clay making it very hard.\n* **Note that the temperature when firing the clay should be raised slowly and not drastically.**\n* This is because clay is porous and when firing, chemically bonded water will try to escape. Now, if suddenly the temperature is raised then the chemically bonded water will not escape suddenly.\n* Instead, the silica fuses into one another trapping the chemically bonded water.\n* Now, at high temperatures, these chemically bonded water turns into steam creating air bubbles.\n* As a result, the clay will disintegrate immediately. Same applies for cooling too. You have to cool the clay very slowly.\n\n## Colors of material at different temperature\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-10.png)\n\n## Quartz Inversion Temperature\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-43.png)\n* Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2) and has a trigonal crystalline structure called as alpha-quartz.\n* At 573 degrees it gets converted into beta-quartz which is hexagonal in shape.\n* So now, it holds clay at 6 points unlike earlier where it holded clay at only 3 points.\n* Now, because of this beta-quartz, the properties of silica change and thus, becomes impervious to water damage.\n* Now, if we cool the clay as soon as it reached 573 degrees, only some part of clay will get converted and majority will disintegrate as soon as it comes in contact of water.\n* Therfore, it is of vital importance that we keep the clay at least equal to 573 degrees for about 2-3 hrs. It depends on how big is the pot.\n* Finally, after quartz inversion takes place, clay turns into ceramics.\n\n## Sintering\n* This is the next phase of clay firing starting at 900 degrees.\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-33-49.png)\n* **After this phase, the water will be retained because of fusion of clay particles.**\n* Pores get removed due to exertion of pressure on each silica particle.\n* This process is called **solid phase sintering.**\n\n## Vitrification\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-41-09.png)\n* After solid phase sintering, there might be some pores that are still left which may allow water to pass.\n* Thus, this next phase is crucial to cover all the pores.\n* In order to lower the melting point of silica, flux is added.\n* Flux is **glassy** in nature. In fact, vitri means glass case.\n* Flux are oxides of metals like calcium, sodian, magnesium, lead, potassion, manganese etc.\n* Now, these oxides (in power form) melt at 1600 degrees and form a liquid.\n* This liquid flows into the pores and solidifies there making the clay fully impervious.\n* This process is called **liquid phase sintering.**\n* **Here, note that silica particles are not melting. It is the flux that is melting.**\n\n## Glazing\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-52-17.png)\n* It beautifies clay by giving it a feel of glass.\n* **Vitreous means glassy.**\n\n## Summary of stages of clay\n* Quartz inversion\n* Solid phase sintering\n* Liquid phase sintering (vitrification).\n* This turns clay to ceramics.\n* Glaze\n\n## Extra Points\n* Melting point of silica = 2000 degress.\n\n---\n\n## Wood\n* This is an organic material and is found in nature.\n* Made from cellulose and bio-organisms can decay these materials.\n* Carving would be easier on wood rather than that on stone because wood is way more softer than stone.\n* Wood is higly porous.\n\n## Surfaces of wood\n* Inlay\n    * Insertion of stone by making a fine cut in the wood.\n* Paint\n* Varnish\n* Gilded\n    * Gold leaf is applied with plaster like substance (to provide adhesiveness to gold leaf) to give wood a appearance of metal.\n* Lacquer\n    * Dip the material in lac which develop aesthetic cracks.\n\n## Important timbers\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-01.png)\n\n## Types of wood\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-10-47.png)\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-11-49.png)\n\n## Components of wood\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-10-12-21.png)\n* If all the water is lost from the wood, then the wood would shrink and vice versa.\n* The exansion and contraction takes place in wood to a great extent. This is because wood is made of cellulose.\n* This changes the shape of wood and this process if called warping of wood.\n* Polysaccharides gives wood its woody appearance. They are just mixture of sugar.\n* Hemicellulose is branched chain and cellulose is composed of mixture of unbranched chain.

Hence, going down the electrochemical series, the reactivity will decrease.\n* Thus, gold is the least reactive metal and hence it is sometimes also called as noble metal.\n* It basically does not react with anything. It only dissolves in aqua regia.\n* Pure copper does not rust/corrode easily and hence they are used for electrical installations.

Two types include anode and cathode.\n* Zinc acts as anode and copper acts as cathode.\n* Electrolyte (Salt Bridge) is of vital importance as it completes the circuit for current to flow.\n* Now once the circuit is complete and current starts flowing, zinc begins to loose electrons.\n* This is because, copper has more reducing potential and as a result has a greater power to pull the electrons.\n* So in time, Zinc gets converted to zinc sulfate and copper sulfate gets converted to pure copper.\n* **To summarize, less reactive metal will get deposited and more reactive metal will get used up during electrolisis.**\n* Thus, to preserve a less reactive metal, just bring a more reactive metal in contact with the less reactive metal. This process is called anodic preferential corrosion or anodic sacrificial protection.\n* Similarly, if a more reactive metal is to be protected than we coat that metal with a less reactive metal and this process is called cathodic protection.

Zinc is more corrosive than iron. Hence swap these two.**\n* Alloys used in heritage\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-39-29.png)\n    * First coin was prepared from electrum. It is also called green gold if available naturally, but artificially made electrum is called white gold because some amount of palladium.\n    * Brass will corrode first as compared to bronze because it has amounts of zinc.\n    * Broze is made from 90% copper and 10% tin. Similar is the case for brass but with its respective metals.\n    * Pewter will appear like silver, but that silvery finish is mainly due to tin and little bit of silver.\n\n## Extra Points\n* Iron is more abundant than copper in earth's crust.\n* But still copper age was before iron.\n* This is because, melting point of iron is much more than that of copper and hence, it was difficult to make iron objects.\n* Gold only dissolves in aqua regia only.\n* Some metal occur in natural form and other in ore form.\n* Stable state of any metal is its rust form and the most active when it is extracted from ore.\n* This active state is achieved by supplying energy to extract it from its ore.\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\yz8zHVdRmNG9ZiqQdYnuU.html","relUrl":"notes\\yz8zHVdRmNG9ZiqQdYnuU.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 2","title":"Lecture 2","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 2","content":"\n# Observing sculptures and studying stones\n\n### Sorry for the inconvinience but please refer this [site](https://aneri12345.github.io/Personal-Log/notes/PnbqLSRQuiLSmhmofal8q.html) for lecture 2 notes.\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\Ggrppf3E3epj19rPtzUTY.html","relUrl":"notes\\Ggrppf3E3epj19rPtzUTY.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 1","title":"Lecture 1","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Heritage Conservation.Lecture 1","content":"\n# Introduction to Conservation\n\n### Sorry for the inconvinience but please refer this [site](https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes/RS0pMLTtuIC0G6hKGBSil.html) for lecture 1 notes.\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\KfgFXSYQDcvTjHz7W9w9R.html","relUrl":"notes\\KfgFXSYQDcvTjHz7W9w9R.html"},{"doc":"Embedded Systems","title":"Embedded Systems","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Embedded Systems","content":"\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\a1PatlsCiz7PYsL111lFm.html","relUrl":"notes\\a1PatlsCiz7PYsL111lFm.html"},{"doc":"Midsem Cheatsheet","title":"Midsem Cheatsheet","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Embedded Systems.Midsem Cheatsheet","content":"\n\r\n## Important Tables\r\n## TCCR0\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-03-12-04-03.png)\r\n## TCCR1A\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-15-26-54.png)\r\n## TCCR1B\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-15-27-23.png)\r\n## TCCR2\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-15-28-48.png)\r\n## Interrupt Vector Table\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-15-34-36.png)\r\n## TIMSK **(FOR INTERNAL INTERRUPT)**\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-15-32-09.png)\r\n## MCUCR **(FOR EXTERNAL INTERRUPT MODE)**\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-15-30-39.png)\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-15-30-58.png)\r\n## GICR\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-03-11-40-27.png)\r\n* Interrupt Addresses\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-15-32-50.png)\r\n## Pull Up\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-03-13-44-02.png)\r\n\r\n## Important Circuits\r\n* AVR Port Pins\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-02-16-46-14.png)\r\n\r\n## Hex To Decimal Code\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-03-11-46-00.png)\n","url":"https://sameep1234.github.io/notes/notes\\ZgP9mkhDoBGKpzGvemxdD.html","relUrl":"notes\\ZgP9mkhDoBGKpzGvemxdD.html"},{"doc":"Lecture 6","title":"Lecture 6","hpath":"courses.Semester 5.Embedded Systems.Lecture 6","content":"\n\r\n# External Hardware Interrupts\r\n\r\n## Activation\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-10-43-25.png)\r\n* Now to activate external hardware interrupt, we use GICR and the first 3 LSB side bits should be set according to our use case and in correspondence with the image above.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-10-45-07.png)\r\n* When we set the interrupts value to be 00, it is also called as **level-triggered interrupt.**\r\n* **Note that 00 corresponds to lower level interrupt which means on connecting group or providing 0, this interrupt will get triggered and on connecting Vcc or providing 1, this interrupt will be disabled.**\r\n* Interrupt 2\r\n    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-29-10-50-01.png)\r\n    * **Note that there is only one bit for interrupt 2 and hence only 2 possible combinations ar shown in the image above.**\r\n* Now for example, lets say we want to make INT0 interrupt on falling edge triggered.
