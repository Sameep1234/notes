# Introduction to Embedded Systems

## Course Material
* Text Book - The AVR Microcontroller and Embedded Systems using Assembly and C by Muhammad Ali Mazidi, Sarmad Naimi and Sepehr Naimi.

## Evaluation Scheme
* End Semester Exam: 30%
* Mid Semester Exam: 25%
* Laboratory Experiments: 45%
* **Relatve Grading**

## Microprocessor
* Brain of the computer
* A programmable integrated device that takes input, uses memory and produces output.

> Now in embedded system, we are moving from microprocessor to microcontroller.

* Key difference between them is that microprocessor, you can use multiple chips whereas for microcontroller, you can't use that.

## Extra Points
* When system performance is critical then use microprocessors
* When issues of space, power and rapid development are critical then use microcontrollers.

> What is embedded system?

* We are talking about microprocessor and microcontroller.
* A way of working, organizing or performing one or many tasks according to a fixed set of rules, program or plan is called a **system**.
* A system that has the following two properties is called an embedded system.
    * software embedded into a computer hardware.
    * which makes a system dedicated for an application or specififc part of an application or product or part of a larger system.
* It is a dedicated purpose software embedded in a computer hardware.

## Classification
* Stand Alone
    * Designed to perform a very specific task **reprtitively**.
    * Non-reactive to the environment conditions.
    * Simplest form of ES.
* Real Time
    * Usually monitors the environment where it is installed.
    * It is required to respond in time to a request.
    * Eg. Systems used in AC.
* Network or Remote Controlled
    * Can be reactive or non-reactive to its environment.
    * Built using specialized communication processor.
    * Eg. Drone
* Mobile
    * Designed to be continuously on the move.
    * Battery Powered

## Components
* Hardware
* Software
    * Higher level programs that can be changed without replacing the hardware.
* Firmware
    * They are small and fixed programs and data structures that internally control various electronic devices.
    * They are very basic low level programs without which a device would not function at all.
