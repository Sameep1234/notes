## Introduction to Embedded Systems

## Course Material

- Text Book - The AVR Microcontroller and Embedded Systems using Assembly and C by Muhammad Ali Mazidi, Sarmad Naimi and Sepehr Naimi.

## Evaluation Scheme

- End Semester Exam: 30%
- Mid Semester Exam: 25%
- Laboratory Experiments: 45%
- **Relatve Grading**

## Microprocessor

- Brain of the computer
- A programmable integrated device that takes input, uses memory and produces output.

> Now in embedded system, we are moving from microprocessor to microcontroller.

- Key difference between them is that in microprocessor you can use multiple chips externally whereas for microcontroller, you can't use that.

## Extra Points

- When system performance is critical then use microprocessors because we can manage the RAM and ROM.
- When issues of space, power and rapid development are critical then use microcontrollers because microcontrollers have built in chips and thus, space and time to develop is less.

> What is embedded system?

- We are talking about microprocessor and microcontroller.
- A way of working, organizing or performing one or many tasks according to a fixed set of rules, program or plan is called a **system**.
- A system that has the following two properties is called an embedded system.
  - software embedded into a computer hardware.
  - which makes a system dedicated for an application or specific part of an application or product or part of a larger system.
- It has a dedicated purpose software embedded in a computer hardware.

## Classification

- Stand Alone
  - Designed to perform a very specific task **repetitively**.
  - Non-reactive to the environment conditions.
  - Simplest form of ES.
- Real Time
  - Usually monitors the environment where it is installed.
  - It is required to respond in time to a request.
  - Eg. Systems used in AC.
- Network or Remote Controlled
  - Can be reactive or non-reactive to its environment.
  - Built using specialized communication processor.
  - Eg. Drone
- Mobile
  - Designed to be continuously on the move.
  - Battery Powered

## Components

- Hardware
- Software
  - Higher level programs that can be changed without replacing the hardware.
- Firmware
  - They are small and fixed programs and data structures that internally control various electronic devices.
  - They are very basic low level programs without which a device would not function at all.
