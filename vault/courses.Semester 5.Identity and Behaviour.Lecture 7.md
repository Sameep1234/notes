## Perception and Factors

## Zone of Proximal Development

- Every individual's learning can be mapped in three concentrix circles.
- Inner most circle represents things that he/she can do on his/her own.
- Outer circle includes things that the learner can't do.
- Whatever lies between these circles is called **zone of proximal development.**
- This zone indicated all those things which a learner can do with some external help.
- This process is called **scaffolding.**
- Example:
  - Riding the bicyle is in outer most circle.
  - Child knows balancing while walking and running and hence is in inner most circle.
  - The father (who holds the bicycle from behind) is basically **operating** in the zone of proximal development.

## Perception

- Perception is a **process** by which we organize and interpret sensory impressions to give **meaning to out environment.**
- People's behaviors are based on their perception of reality and not the actual reality itself.
- Eg. The perception will depend on how severe the consequences are like that example of confiscation of phone.
