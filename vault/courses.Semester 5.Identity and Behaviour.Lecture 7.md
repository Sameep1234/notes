# Perception and Factors

## Zone of Proximal Development
* Every individual's learning can be mapped in three concentrix circles.
* Inner most circle represents things that he/she can do on his/her own.
* Outer circle includes things that the learner can't do.
* Whatever lies between these circles is called **zone of proximal development.**
* This zone indicated all those things which a learner can do with some external help.
* This process is called **scaffolding.**
* Example:
    * Riding the bicyle is in outer most circle.
    * Child knows balancing while walking and running and hence is in inner most circle.
    * The father (who holds the bicycle from behind) is basically **operating** in the zone of proximal development.

## Perception
* Perception is a **process** by which we organize and interpret sensory impressions to give **meaning to out environment.**
* People's behaviors are based on their perception of reality and not the actual reality itself.
* Eg. The perception will depend on how severe the consequences are like that example of confiscation of phone.
