# Paper (Cont.)

## Bleaching (Cont.)
* Oxidising and reducing bleaching agents.
* Chromophoric groups are the functional groups that impart color to paper.
* Bleaching agent breaks down these groups by changing the double bond of chromophoric groups into single bond.
* They change the optical properties of chromophoric groups.
* As a result, the paper becomes white.

## Sizing and Loading

* These process gives dimensional stability to paper.
* Sizing (a material that is amphiphilic) has two purposes
    * Blocks the pores in paper
    * Does not let the ink to pass through
* Loading material is added to increase the weight of paper.
* Chalk is one of the loading material. 
* But on adding chalk it provides glossiness to the paper.
* Thus, to remove it we need some other chemical process.
* Optical brightning agents are used for increasing the brightness of the paper.

## Inks
* Carbon ink
    * Lamp Black ink or soot of lamp.
    * Collect the carbon soot from a burning lamp and use it as ink.
    * Oil is also there which binds the ink onto the paper.
* Iron gall ink
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-18-52-36.png)
    * Chemical name of iron gall ink is ferrous tannate.
    * It is soluble in water but when it is exposed to atmospheric oxygen it is converted to ferric tannate.
    * This is permanent insoluble in water. It is very dark.
    * Problem with this ink is that it contains iron and is prone to rusting.
    * Thus, ghost writing occurs (writing appearing on other side of paper).
    * Calcium phytate treatment is one solution to prevent further rusting of iron gall ink.
    * **It is used in ancient manuscript.**

## Extra Points
* Cellulose is hydrophilic.
* Absorption rate for paper (cellulose)
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-21-42-08.png)
    * Monomer of cellulose is made of 6 hydroxyl ion.
    * When it comes in contact of hydrogen, it easily forms water and thus it is hydrophilic.

# Textiles
* Generally, we see cotton, silk, linen, nylon, khadi and wool thread in textiles.
* Cotton, Linen and Silk are natural soft threads.
* Silver, gold and copper threads are metallic hard threads.
* Both these types are constantly in friction and hence they wear away.
* Metallic thread are heavy and thus damage both of them (natural and metallic thread).
