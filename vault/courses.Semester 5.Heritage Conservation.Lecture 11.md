## Paper (Cont.)

## Bleaching (Cont.)

- Oxidising and reducing bleaching agents.
- Chromophoric groups are the functional groups that impart color to paper.
- Bleaching agent breaks down these groups by changing the double bond of chromophoric groups into single bond.
- They change the optical properties of chromophoric groups.
- As a result, the paper becomes white.

## Sizing and Loading

- These process gives dimensional stability to paper.
- Sizing (a material that is amphiphilic) has two purposes
  - Blocks the pores in paper
  - Does not let the ink to pass through
- Loading material is added to increase the weight of paper.
- Chalk is one of the loading material. 
- But on adding chalk it provides glossiness to the paper.
- Thus, to remove it we need some other chemical process.
- Optical brightning agents are used for increasing the brightness of the paper.

## Inks

- Carbon ink
  - Lamp Black ink or soot of lamp.
  - Collect the carbon soot from a burning lamp and use it as ink.
  - Oil is also there which binds the ink onto the paper.
- Iron gall ink
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-18-52-36.png)
  - Chemical name of iron gall ink is ferrous tannate.
  - It is soluble in water but when it is exposed to atmospheric oxygen it is converted to ferric tannate.
  - This is permanent insoluble in water. It is very dark.
  - Problem with this ink is that it contains iron and is prone to rusting.
  - Thus, ghost writing occurs (writing appearing on other side of paper).
  - Calcium phytate treatment is one solution to prevent further rusting of iron gall ink.
  - **It is used in ancient manuscript.**

## Extra Points

- Cellulose is hydrophilic.
- Absorption rate for paper (cellulose)
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-21-42-08.png)
  - Monomer of cellulose is made of 6 hydroxyl ion.
  - When it comes in contact of hydrogen, it easily forms water and thus it is hydrophilic.

* * *

- Generally, we see cotton, silk, linen, nylon, khadi and wool thread in textiles.
- Cotton, Linen and Silk are natural soft threads.
- Silver, gold and copper threads are metallic hard threads.
- Both these types are constantly in friction and hence they wear away.
- Metallic thread are heavy and thus damage both of them (natural and metallic thread).
