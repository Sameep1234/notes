## Control Systems

## Introduction

- System which controls a physical quantity.
- Components of control system
  - Control element (Eg. Timer)
  - Plant (Eg. Heating coil)
- Type of control system
  - Open Loop: Control action is independent of the control variable.
    - We must assume the timer setting to be correct.

  - Closed Loop: Control action is dependent of the control variable.
    - User will have manual control.
    - Feedback recieved with the help of human senses. Can also be used as feedback in automatic control systems. For this, the feedback has to be electrical.
    - This means that the control action depends on the output variable.
  - There are various other factors which can't be known and hence are assumed to be constant. For example, ageing and changes in load weight. 
  - The main difference between open loop and close loop system is of feedback which is not present in open loop system.

## Steady state calculation

- A is the gain of the amplifier. It is dimensionless. Also called as the loop gain.
- Km is the motor constant. Upto Km, we will get the **speed** of the motor.
- Ks is the sensor constant. Speed sensors input is speed and output is voltage. Dimension of Ks is opposite tso that of Km. Ks = $\\frac{Vf}{N}$.
- N = speed in rpm.
- A_Km_Ks is called the loop gain of the system. So larger its value, the smaller is the difference and hence we get almost equal value to Vs.
- So it is better to obtain loop gain of 100 and it is achievable.

## Specification of control systems

- Accuracy of output in steady state.
- Speed of response.
- Feedback (Improves both).
  - Because of this, the effective time constant is reduced and hence speed and accuracy is improved.

## Example of Oven

- Block Diagram

- The rate of increase depends on thermal resistance and thermal capacitance.
- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-42-28.png)
- Heat flow is in watts. Theta is in degrees and thus thermal resistance is in degrees per watts.

- Mathematical model of oven

- **For steady state**
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-19-14-47-40.png)
  - 'q' is the coil wattage of the oven.
- Electrical Equivalent

  - Note that the electrical equations are just the analogous equations.

## Set Point and Closed system equivalent

- The temperature reached in steady state is called set point.
- For oven, it is qR.

- Left hand side part is the steady state voltage and as evident from the figure it has some error.
- However, if Kp is chosen to be very large as compared to 1, this error is highly reduced.
- The coefficient of $\\frac{dVo}{dt}$ is time constant and here in our case it is $\\frac{RC}{Kp + 1}$.
- Thus, on increasing Kp, time constant is reduced and a faster response is obtained.

## Loading effect in Open Loop System

- **Note that the steady state voltage is reduced by half and this is a significant drop.**

## Loaded system with feedback

- Slight difference is there in the denominator.
