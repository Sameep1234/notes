## Ceramic and Intro to Wood

## Firing stages of clay

- First firing is called bisquing and second firing is called glazing.
- There are two types of water molecules that are bonded with clay viz physically bonded water and chemically bonded water.
- During bone dry stage of clay, the physically bonded water is released.
- Now to remove, chemically bonded water, we fire the clay. This immense heating causing chemically binded water to detach from the clay making it very hard.
- **Note that the temperature when firing the clay should be raised slowly and not drastically.**
- This is because clay is porous and when firing, chemically bonded water will try to escape. Now, if suddenly the temperature is raised then the chemically bonded water will not escape suddenly.
- Instead, the silica fuses into one another trapping the chemically bonded water.
- Now, at high temperatures, these chemically bonded water turns into steam creating air bubbles.
- As a result, the clay will disintegrate immediately. Same applies for cooling too. You have to cool the clay very slowly.

## Quartz Inversion Temperature

- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-26-43.png)
- Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2) and has a trigonal crystalline structure called as alpha-quartz.
- At 573 degrees it gets converted into beta-quartz which is hexagonal in shape.
- So now, it holds clay at 6 points unlike earlier where it holded clay at only 3 points.
- Now, because of this beta-quartz, the properties of silica change and thus, becomes impervious to water damage.
- Now, if we cool the clay as soon as it reached 573 degrees, only some part of clay will get converted and majority will disintegrate as soon as it comes in contact of water.
- Therfore, it is of vital importance that we keep the clay at least equal to 573 degrees for about 2-3 hrs. It depends on how big is the pot.
- Finally, after quartz inversion takes place, clay turns into ceramics.

## Sintering

- This is the next phase of clay firing starting at 900 degrees.

- **After this phase, the water will be retained because of fusion of clay particles.**
- Pores get removed due to exertion of pressure on each silica particle.
- This process is called **solid phase sintering.**

## Vitrification

- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-41-09.png)
- After solid phase sintering, there might be some pores that are still left which may allow water to pass.
- Thus, this next phase is crucial to cover all the pores.
- In order to lower the melting point of silica, flux is added.
- Flux is **glassy** in nature. In fact, vitri means glass case.
- Flux are oxides of metals like calcium, sodian, magnesium, lead, potassion, manganese etc.
- Now, these oxides (in power form) melt at 1600 degrees and form a liquid.
- This liquid flows into the pores and solidifies there making the clay fully impervious.
- This process is called **liquid phase sintering.**
- **Here, note that silica particles are not melting. It is the flux that is melting.**

## Glazing

- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-12-09-52-17.png)
- It beautifies clay by giving it a feel of glass.
- **Vitreous means glassy.**

## Summary of stages of clay

- Quartz inversion
- Solid phase sintering
- Liquid phase sintering (vitrification).
- This turns clay to ceramics.
- Glaze

## Extra Points

- Melting point of silica = 2000 degress.

## Wood

- This is an organic material and is found in nature.
- Made from cellulose and bio-organisms can decay these materials.
- Carving would be easier on wood rather than that on stone because wood is way more softer than stone.
- Wood is higly porous.

## Surfaces of wood

- Inlay
  - Insertion of stone by making a fine cut in the wood.
- Paint
- Varnish
- Gilded
  - Gold leaf is applied with plaster like substance (to provide adhesiveness to gold leaf) to give wood a appearance of metal.
- Lacquer
  - Dip the material in lac which develop aesthetic cracks.

## Components of wood

- If all the water is lost from the wood, then the wood would shrink and vice versa.
- The exansion and contraction takes place in wood to a great extent. This is because wood is made of cellulose.
- This changes the shape of wood and this process if called warping of wood.
- Polysaccharides gives wood its woody appearance. They are just mixture of sugar.
- Hemicellulose is branched chain and cellulose is composed of mixture of unbranched chain. Former is a mixture of sugar whereas latter is the mixture of glucose.
- Lignin acts as a binding agent and gives wood its hardness and softness. This means that if lignin is less than bonding is less and vice versa.
- **Phenol is aromatic alcohol.**
