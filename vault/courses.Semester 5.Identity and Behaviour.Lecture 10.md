## Decision Making and its related errors

- When there is a problem, we make a decision and to the method is to choose one of the alternatives that we have in front of us.
- Problem can be considered as discrepancy exists between current state of affairs and desired state.
- In simpler terms, it is the difference between what we have and what we want.

## Rational decision making model

- Rational - making consistent **value maximing choices** within spcified constraints.
- Model
  - identify the problem.
  - Identify the decision criteria.
  - Allocate weights to the criteria.
  - Develop the alternatives.
  - Evaluate the alternatives.
  - Select the best one.
- Assumptions
  - All information is available.
  - Evaluate information in unbiased manner.
  - select option with highest utility.

## Bounded Rationality

- A process of making decisions by constructing **simplified models** that extract the **essential features** from problem without capturing all their complexity.
- It includes choosing of that option which is satisfactory and sufficient to one's needs.
- How is this done?
  - Alternatives that are highly visible.
  - Reviewing alternatives focusing on choice that differ from current state.
  - Until we find good enough option
- **Note that in bounded rationality we do not focus on value maximisation but choose that option which is "good enough" for our use case.**
- To search quickly, majority of the "e-commerce" sites have filters, customer reviews etc.

## Intuition

- An **unconscious** process created out of **distilled experience**.
- Unconscious process means that we don't know that we are actually thinking about that decision.
- Unconcious proceeses are usually fast, relies on thinking information from different sources and engages with emotion.
- Expert based intuition decision can be very accurate and thus it can help in effective decision making.
