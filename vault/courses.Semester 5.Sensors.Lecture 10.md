## Temperature Sensor

## Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD)

- Typical value of R0 is 100 ohms and that of alpha will depend on the material and geometry of the setting.

- Usually in real world, the RTD is placed in the heated chamber and you will be located far away. This means that the wires would have some resistance.
- Therefore, the voltage you get is actually the potential drop from RTD and the wires.
- This might lead to large errors.

  - The drop in the inner wires can be neglected because the volmeter has high resistance and hence calibration will remain valid.

- Cold junction compensation
  - Copper wire will have some resitance and thermocouple materials used.
  - Thus, cold junction will also have different voltage than hot end.
  - Hence, we need to compensate.
