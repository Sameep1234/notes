# Session with Viveick Rajgopalan


* Music is not an individual frequency but a collective form. 
    * Just like we cannot see whats inside any human body(the whole anatomy behind)
* Why is there a need of mathematics and science for music?
   * We need to impact correctly in our multiple listners accurately
   * It is like flying a plane, we need to have knowledge about all the variables.
> _Music is not about perfection, but the recognition of ones errors makes the difference. It is important to be persistent(Sadhna)._

## Ta Dhoom

* The key to progress is to observe/ copy and learn.
* Classes were taken for 2 hrs for 8 months to the students understand phrasing and rythm better.
* Literacy was focused instead of education 
* It was an inspiration to India 91

## Feeling the tempo: 
* Singing along with clapping helps to maintain rythm and gives measure to each interval between a clap.
* Each clap is said to be a dot.
### The sing alongs:  
* 5 dots - Ta ka ta ki t 
* 4 dots - Ta ka dhi mi
* 3 dots - Ta ki ta
* 16 odts - Adi tala
* Konnakol: Different phases along with dot manipulations is used in

* **_Formless represents the beauty and not the chaos_**
* According to mathematical perception, the beats seem converging towards the end and later diverges with a start.

> _It is very important for a mucisian - be persistent _
> The sequence to a music: beats grabs ones attention, while thats not it. The listeners hold on to the music/song through the lyrics.
