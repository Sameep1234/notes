## Session with Viveick Rajgopalan

- Music is not an individual frequency but a collective form. 
  - Just like we cannot see whats inside any human body(the whole anatomy behind)
- Why is there a need of mathematics and science for music?
  - We need to impact correctly in our multiple listners accurately
  - It is like flying a plane, we need to have knowledge about all the variables.
    > _Music is not about perfection, but the recognition of ones errors makes the difference. It is important to be persistent(Sadhna)._

## Ta Dhoom

- Ta Dhoom - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw0dI8RZcNM>
- The key to progress is to observe/ copy and learn.
- Classes were taken for 2 hrs for 8 months to the students understand phrasing and rythm better.
- Literacy was focused instead of education 
- It was an inspiration to India 91

## Feeling the tempo:

- Singing along with clapping helps to maintain rythm and gives measure to each interval between a clap.
- Each clap is said to be a dot.

### The sing alongs:

- 5 dots - Ta ka ta ki t 
- 4 dots - Ta ka dhi mi
- 3 dots - Ta ki ta
- 16 odts - Adi tala
- Konnakol: Different phases along with dot manipulations is used in

- **_Formless represents the beauty and not the chaos_**
- According to mathematical perception, the beats seem converging towards the end and later diverges with a start.

> _It is very important for a mucisian - be persistent _
> The sequence to a music: beats grabs ones attention, while thats not it. The listeners hold on to the music/song through the lyrics.
