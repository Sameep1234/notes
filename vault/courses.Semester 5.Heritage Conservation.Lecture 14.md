- Pigment is earth colors, binder and vehicle is oil.

## Extra Points

- Varnish acts as a protective layer and it enhances the colors also.
- Thus, if the dusts settles on painting, we remove the varnish layer and recoat it with varnish.
- This way the paintings are preserved for a long time.
- Sometimes binder acts as both binder and vehicle to let the paint flow.
