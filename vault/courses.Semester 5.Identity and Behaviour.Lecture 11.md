## Types of values

    * Desirable **end-states of existence**. It is basically the end goal that one wants to achieve.

    * Preferred modes of behaviour or means of achieving terminal values.
* Note that terminal values can be same but the instrumental values you choose to achieve those can differ from person to person.
