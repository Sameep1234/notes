# Museum Climate

## Ways
* Intervention active
* Passive Protection
    * I am not touching the object.
    * Just controlling the environment around the object.
    * However, think in terms of **microclimate.**
    * For example, there is an object in a glass case, then the inside of the case is microclimate.
    * Microclimate separates the inner climate with the outer climate.

## Factors
* Temperature
* Humidity
    * Absolute Humidity
        * ![](/assets/images/2021-12-04-10-37-20.png)
        * Absolute humidity is mass of water vapour in air per cubic meter of air.
        * Very difficult to measure.
        * Thus, we use relative humidity
    * Relative Humidity
        * ![](/assets/images/2021-12-04-10-39-11.png)
        * RH = 50% --> Confortable for objects and humans.
        * RH > 50% = Humid
        * RH < 50% = Dry
        * RH = 100 % --> Air is saturated with water vapor and precipitation may start.
        * If RH is same, then lower the temperature, lesser the amount of water vapor present.
        * This is because at lower temperature, if the water vapor increases by even a small percentage, it will precipitate.
        * Thus, if RH is same, lower temperatures are more comfortable.
* Lighting conditions
* Pollutants

## Dew Point

* High dew point will be uncomfortable because it contains high water vapor contents and vice versa.

## Instruments
* Sling Psychrometer (RH Measuring)
    - Two kinds of thermometer - dry bulb and wet bulb thermometer
    - The difference between the readings of both is taken and then compared with the data table to give value of RH.

    * ![](/assets/images/2021-12-04-10-54-55.png)
* Thermohygrograph (Temp and Humidity Measuring)
Works on the principle that organic materials expand and contract as the RH changes. (Here the organic materail is human hair)
It measures temperature and humidity and plots it on a chart to monitor environmental changes.


> Data loggers for Temp, RH Monitoring and Dew Point
- Wifi connected to get readings - also can be connected via computer to get data

> 765 Environmental Monitor (Visible Light, UV Light, Temperature and Humidity)
- very useful

## Controlling Humidity

* Coarse Silica Gel (Dessicant - humidity indicator)
It is crystal blue in colour when dry, when it absorbs water it turns into pink. It can be reconditioned (used again by putting in oven at 120&deg C for 20 minutes so it turns blue again)
