## Timer (Cont.)

## Extra Points

- If prescaling is applied, we multiply the time period of the AVR microcontroller by the same amount as the prescaling ratio.
- Prescaler simply means that we are increasing the time period of the clock. Consequently, we are decreasing the frequency of the clock.

- To clear any flag, write logic **"1"** to it.

## TIFR Circuit

- It is an 8-bit register.

- Stores flags and **overflow flag is set on 0th bit**.

- Value "1" implies overflowed and vice versa.

- Prescalers slows down the clock. Hence increases the time period.

- Thus, multiply the prescaler to clock time period to get the adequate delay.

- Overflow flag is located on 0th bit. Hence to check overflow we check TIFR & 0x1 to be 0.

- **Make sure that to reset the flag by putting "1" to the flag.**

- The reason for this could be understood using an analogy. These are not the direct registers. These like control registers which means they act as a switch. We are pressing the "reset" switch (by putting "1") and in turn it is telling the actual register to reset the values. Thus, instead of 0, we are passing 1.

  - Toggle bits on 4th Pin of PORTB continuously with delay of 70 microseconds. Use Timer0, normal mode and 1:8 prescaler. Frequency of clock is 8MHz.

```c
#include<avr/io.h>

void T0Delay() {
    TCNT0 = 0xBA; // Calculated using the formula
    TCCR0 = 0x02; // 1:8 prescaler value using the table
    while((TIFR & 0x1) == 0); // Continuously run until flag is activated
    TCCR0 = 0; // Stop the clock
    TIFR = 0x1; // Reset the values.
}

void main() {
	DDRB = 0x10; // PORTB.4 is declared as output pin
	while(1) // Run forever
	{
		PORTB = 0x10; // Turn on
        T0Delay(); // Apply delay
        PORTB = 0x00; // Turn off
        T0Delay(); // Apply delay
	}
}
```
