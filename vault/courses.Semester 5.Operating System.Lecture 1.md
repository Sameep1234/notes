## Introduction to Operating System

## Course Material

- Textbook - Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles, 9th Edition, by William Stallings, Pearson

## Computing System

> Basic purpose is to perform computation on input data and generate results

- Comprised of hardware, software and data.
- Secondary storage stores all the programs (like code in C).
- To execute it, first load it into the memory (RAM).
- For any program to run by the processor, first fetch, then execute and then finally check for the interrupts.

> Operating System will perform the task of loading the program from secondary memory (Hard Disks) to main memory (RAM)

## Functions of OS

- I/O Management
- Process Management
- Memory Management
- File Management

> Operating system is a program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.

## Objectives of OS

- Convenience - Makes computer easy to use
- Efficiency - Manages resources efficiently
- Ability to evolve - Easy to adapt changes

## Users of Computing System

- End User - Use the application as it is. Eg. Excel Users
- Programmer - Developing applications. Need to understand utility programs and OS
- Operating System Designer/System Level Programmer - Creates OS/**Works with computer hardware**/Develop or write a driver

> Driver is a piece of software that understands a hardware. It understands the internals of the attached hardware.

## Services provided by OS

> Through these services OS attains "Convenience".

- Program development
- Program execution
- Access I/O devices (Eg. CDs, Pendrives)
- Controlled access to files (Provides protection in multi-access systems (Eg. Multiple users in same laptop))
- System access
- Error detection and response (Eg. Errors in reading CDs)
- Accounting (Collect usage statistics/Monitor performance)

## Resource Management

- Movement
- Storage
- Processing of data

> OS is a program that is executed by the CPU! (Kind of ironic. OS handles CPU but is executed by CPU XD)
