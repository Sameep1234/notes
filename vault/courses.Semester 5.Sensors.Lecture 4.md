## TinkerCAD

> This lecture included the demo of TinkerCAD and hence there are not much notes of it.

## Extra Points

- [Arduino Code Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)
- Digital Read Function
  - Pin from which digital input is read.
  - Syntax: x = digitalRead(Inpin);
- Analog Read
  - Syntax: x = analogread(potPin);
  - x ranges between 0 to 1023.
- Serial Communication
  - Syntax = Serial.begin(9600)
  - This has to be used in setup part of the program structure.
  - Will establish serial communication between computer monitor and Arduino.
  - Syntax: Serial.println("ADC Output");
  - This will print it as a string on the monitor.
- Digital to Analog Conversion calculation
