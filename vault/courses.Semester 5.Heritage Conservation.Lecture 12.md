## Textiles

## Properties

- **Note that the only natural fibre available as filament fibre is silk.**
- **Most of the natural fibres are staple except silk which is a filament fibre.**

- As it can be seen filament fibres are stronger than staple fibres.
- Further, the filament fibres are smooth (because there are no joints) whereas staple fibers are rough (because they have several joints).
- Thus, almost all synthetic clothes are smooth.

- Cotton has high wrinkles whereas wool does not.

## Extra Points

- Wool has great capacity to hold water. In fact it is greater than cotton.
- Cotton is a good conductor of heat and we wear it in summer so that all the heat is transfered/escapes to the atmosphere. Wool has vice versa effect.
- **All textiles have high absorption property because it is made of cellulose and hence is hydrophilic**.
- Cotton is quite resistant to alkalis even to strong ones whereas wool is highly resistant to acids.
- Thus for wool, you want acidic conditions whereas for cotton you want alkaline conditions and hence they are not washed/cleaned together.
