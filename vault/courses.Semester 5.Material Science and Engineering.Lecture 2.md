## Atomic Structure, Bonding and Energy

## Classification of materials

![](/assets/images/2021-08-28-10-22-07.png)

- Types of materials
  - Semiconductor
  - Polymer
  - Metals
  - Ceramics
  - Biomaterials
  - Composites

> Composite material is formed by the combination of two or more types of materials. But why do we need composite materials?

- Reduce Weight
- Lowers the cost of the material
- Gives strength to the device
- **Mediates propogation of charge/current**

## Atomic structure

- Atomic mass unit = 1/12 of the mass of most common isotope of carbon.
- Atomic weight is weighted average of atomic masses of naturally occuring isotopes.
- A mole is amount of matter with mass in grams equal to atomic mass in amu.
- A mole of carbon has a mass of 12 grams.
- **One mole has 6.023 x 10^23 number of atoms (also called as Avogadro's number)**
- Number density formula:

Here Nav = avogadro's number, $\\rho$ = mass density and A = atomic mass

- De broglie wavelength:

### Electronic Structure of isolated atoms

- n  principal shell (1,2,3... or K,L,M...)
- l = anular (sub shell) (s,p,d,f)
- ml = magnetic (-l to +l including 0)
- ms = spin (1/2, -1/2)

> Ionization potential is the energy required to pull out a valence electron (in vacuum) and by convention it is positive. Electron affinity is energy gained by putting an electron in (from vacuum) and by convention it is negative.

> Electronegativity is the measure of how likely an atom will take up or give up an electron.

- Valence electrons determine the physical properties viz chemical, electrical, thermal and optical
- Electropositive elements easily give up electrons to become positive ions. These generally rest in the left sife of the periodic table and vice versa for electronegative elements.
- This means electronegativity is smaller on left side and larger on the right side.

## Bonding in solids

- At large distances, interactions are negligible and at small distances each atom exerts forces on the other.
- These include, force of attraction and that of repulsion.

- Fnet = Fr + Fa. At equilibrium Fnet = 0
- Usually the distance between the two atoms at equilibrium position is 0.3nm.

## Potential Energy

> **Here potential energy and energy are used interchangebly.**

- Energy is integration of foice wrt the radius.
- Enet = Ea + Er.
- **Relation between force and energy is that energy is integration of force.**

- Attraction energy = -A/r and Repulsive energy = B/power(r,n)
- E0 = Bonding energy at minimum distance. This means that it is the energy required to seperate two atoms to an infinite seperation.
- It the curve above is deep, this implies that the material is rigid and inflexible and vice versa.
- If the double derivative of the energy (equivalent to single derivative of force equation) equation at r = r0 is less than 0 then it is stable and vice versa.
- To find the equalibrium position, make the single derivative of the energy equation (equivalent to the force equation) equal to 0.
- The mechanical stiffness (elasticity) of a material is dependent on the shapr of its F vs r diagram.
- Steep curve means relatively stiff and vice versa.

## Ionic Bonding

- Generally takes place between metals and non-metals. There is a complete transfer of electron.
- **Difference between electronegativity is of prime importance. Ionic bonding only occurs between atoms with large differences in electronegativity.**
- Cation = Positive Ion, Anion = Negative Ion
- Primary Bonding means that electrons are completely transferred. Atoms do so to acheive stable configuration. Such type of bonding is very strong (columbic force in case of ionic bonding). (Eg. Ionic, Covalent and Metallic)
- Ionic bonds are non-directional whereas covalent bonds are directional in nature. **Non-directional means that the magnitude of bond is equal in all directions around an ion.**
- Secondary Bonding means that electrons are shared. This type of bonding is weaker compared to primary bonding. (Eg. inert gases (H2, Cl2) or permanet dipoles (H20, HCl))
- Enet (due to all attractions and repulsions) is known as **madelung energy**.
- The predominant bonding in **ceramic materials** is **ionic.**

## Covalent Bonding

- **Covalent bonding occurs between atoms with small differences in electronegativity.**
- The stable electroninc configuration is achieved by **sharing of electrons**.
- Generally occur between non-metals and is directional bond.
- Number of colvalent bonds is determined by the number of valence electrons.
- Percent of ionic characters:

- Here Xa and Xb are the electronegativities of elements a and b. Greater the difference between electronegativities, greater is the ionic bonding and vice versa.

## Metallic Bonding

- Found in metals and their alloys.
- According to the model presented, the valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom in the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal.
- Thus, these are called as electron clound as the electrons are all over the metal.
- The remaining non-valence electrons and nucleus form the ion core and **posses a net positive charge** equal to total valence electrons charge per atom.
- The free electrons sheild the positively charged ion cores from mutually repulsive electrostatic forces along with acting as a **glue**.
- Because of the availability of free electrons, metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity.

## Van der waals bodning

- All the above mentioned bonds are **primary** bonds and this type of bond is **secondary** in nature.
- It is weaker as compared to primary bonds.
- It is virtually ubiquitous but presence of primary bonds diminishes their effect.
- Usually found between **inert gases**.
- Dipoles are formed which exists whenever there is some separation of positive and negative portions of an atom or molecule.
- Hydrogen bonding is a special type of secondary bonding that exists metweeb some molecules that have hydrogen as one of its constituents.
