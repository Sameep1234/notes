## Hardness of Stones and Introduction to metals

## Mohs Hardness Scale

- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-14-42-38.png)
- Gypsum
  - Used as one of the raw components of cement and its called calcium sulphate.
  - It is really soft.
- Calcite
  - Chief component of limestone and marble.
  - It is called Calcium Carbonate
- Quartz
  - It is very hard.
  - Used in sandstone and granite
  - Hence, these materials are also hard.
  - It is called silicon dioxide.
  - Harder than Gypsum and Calcite as evident from the above figure.
  - Artifacts of sandstone have different colors like shown in below image.
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-05-34.png)
  - This means that if **iron content** is more, then it **gives red** color and if **clay content** is more, then it **gives yellow** color.
  - The red color of the red fort is red because of ferruginous sandstone. This iron gets rusted and gives red color.
  - The yellow colored sandstone is called as argilesious sandstone.

## Use of stones in monuments

- Humanyun's Tomb, Delhi
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-09-03.png)
  - Made using sandstone (red colored) and marble (white colored).

- Taj Mahal, Agra
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-10-02.png)
  - Again made using sandstone (main platform) and brick and marble (outer/external padding).
  - Iron slabs/rod are used to padd marble and hence we can see some rusting where iron is inserted.

- **Note: Sandstone is always at base and marble is at top. Marble is a porous stone.**

  > Why is it not the reverse?
  >
  > - This is because, sandstone is a stronger than marble and hence has the capacity to hold the weight of marble.

- Biwi ka maqbara, Aurangabad
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-16-57.png)
  - Made using a very fine and polished limestone and only 25% marble is used.

## Extra Points

- Average temperature of venus is 470 degrees.
- Mars surface temperature is -53 degrees.
- Earth's surface temperature earlier was 290 degrees and nowadays it is 15 degrees.
  > What was the climatic condition that led it to cool down?
  >
  > - It was covered with Carbon Dioxide, but during formation of limestone, more than 80% of the gas was consumed and thus, the earth's surface temperature cooled.
- During the production of cement, we are reversing the formation of limestone.
- Thus, we are releasing a lot of carbon dioxide.
- Stones used in formation of qutub minar are marble, sandstone and **quartzite.**
- Based on quartizite, Alai Minar in Delhi was made. Originally, it was supposed to be a replica of Qutub Minar with double height, but could not be completed.
- Kailashnath Temple, Ellora is made using Basalt which is extrunious igneous rock formed by volcanic rocks.
- Brihadishwar Temple, Tanjavur is made using granite.
- **Anything that has to migrate from one surface to other surface, the other surface must be more porous compared to the first one.**


- Most of the metals are subject to corrosion due to atmospheric moisture.
- Metals used in heritage
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-37-31.png)
  - These metals are placed in the order of their corrsion resistance and hardness.
  - **There is a mistake in the photo. Zinc is more corrosive than iron. Hence swap these two.**
- Alloys used in heritage
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-39-29.png)
  - First coin was prepared from electrum. It is also called green gold if available naturally, but artificially made electrum is called white gold because some amount of palladium.
  - Brass will corrode first as compared to bronze because it has amounts of zinc.
  - Broze is made from 90% copper and 10% tin. Similar is the case for brass but with its respective metals.
  - Pewter will appear like silver, but that silvery finish is mainly due to tin and little bit of silver.

## Extra Points

- Iron is more abundant than copper in earth's crust.
- But still copper age was before iron.
- This is because, melting point of iron is much more than that of copper and hence, it was difficult to make iron objects.
- Gold only dissolves in aqua regia only.
- Some metal occur in natural form and other in ore form.
- Stable state of any metal is its rust form and the most active when it is extracted from ore.
- This active state is achieved by supplying energy to extract it from its ore.
