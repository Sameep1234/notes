# Hardness of Stones and Introduction to metals

## Mohs Hardness Scale
* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-14-42-38.png)
* Gypsum
    * Used as one of the raw components of cement and its called calcium sulphate.
    * It is really soft.
* Calcite
    * Chief component of limestone and marble.
    * It is called Calcium Carbonate
* Quartz
    * It is very hard.
    * Used in sandstone and granite
    * Hence, these materials are also hard.
    * It is called silicon dioxide.
    * Harder than Gypsum and Calcite as evident from the above figure.
    * Artifacts of sandstone have different colors like shown in below image.
        * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-05-34.png)
    * This means that if **iron content** is more, then it **gives red** color and if **clay content** is more, then it **gives yellow** color.
    * The red color of the red fort is red because of ferruginous sandstone. This iron gets rusted and gives red color.
    * The yellow colored sandstone is called as argilesious sandstone.

## Use of stones in monuments
* Humanyun's Tomb, Delhi
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-09-03.png)
    * Made using sandstone (red colored) and marble (white colored).
* Taj Mahal, Agra
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-10-02.png)
    * Again made using sandstone (main platform) and brick and marble (outer/external padding).
    * Iron slabs/rod are used to padd marble and hence we can see some rusting where iron is inserted.

* **Note: Sandstone is always at base and marble is at top. Marble is a porous stone.**

    > Why is it not the reverse?
    * This is because, sandstone is a stronger than marble and hence has the capacity to hold the weight of marble.
* Biwi ka maqbara, Aurangabad
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-16-57.png)
    * Made using a very fine and polished limestone and only 25% marble is used.

## Extra Points
* Average temperature of venus is 470 degrees.
* Mars surface temperature is -53 degrees.
* Earth's surface temperature earlier was 290 degrees and nowadays it is 15 degrees.
    > What was the climatic condition that led it to cool down?
    * It was covered with Carbon Dioxide, but during formation of limestone, more than 80% of the gas was consumed and thus, the earth's surface temperature cooled.
* During the production of cement, we are reversing the formation of limestone.
* Thus, we are releasing a lot of carbon dioxide.
* Stones used in formation of qutub minar are marble, sandstone and **quartzite.**
* Based on quartizite, Alai Minar in Delhi was made. Originally, it was supposed to be a replica of Qutub Minar with double height, but could not be completed.
* Kailashnath Temple, Ellora is made using Basalt which is extrunious igneous rock formed by volcanic rocks.
* Brihadishwar Temple, Tanjavur is made using granite.
* **Anything that has to migrate from one surface to other surface, the other surface must be more porous compared to the first one.**

# Metals
* Most of the metals are subject to corrosion due to atmospheric moisture.
* Metals used in heritage
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-37-31.png)
    * These metals are placed in the order of their corrsion resistance and hardness.
    * **There is a mistake in the photo. Zinc is more corrosive than iron. Hence swap these two.**
* Alloys used in heritage
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-17-39-29.png)
    * First coin was prepared from electrum. It is also called green gold if available naturally, but artificially made electrum is called white gold because some amount of palladium.
    * Brass will corrode first as compared to bronze because it has amounts of zinc.
    * Broze is made from 90% copper and 10% tin. Similar is the case for brass but with its respective metals.
    * Pewter will appear like silver, but that silvery finish is mainly due to tin and little bit of silver.

## Extra Points
* Iron is more abundant than copper in earth's crust.
* But still copper age was before iron.
* This is because, melting point of iron is much more than that of copper and hence, it was difficult to make iron objects.
* Gold only dissolves in aqua regia only.
* Some metal occur in natural form and other in ore form.
* Stable state of any metal is its rust form and the most active when it is extracted from ore.
* This active state is achieved by supplying energy to extract it from its ore.
