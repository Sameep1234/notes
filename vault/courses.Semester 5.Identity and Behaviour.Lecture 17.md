# Job Dissatisfaction and Job Crafting

## Extra Points
* Job satisfaction is the positive feeling that we associate with our jobs.
* To measure it we have two methods
    * Global rating which just asks one question that all things considered, how satisfied are you with your jobs?
    * Very quick
    * Summation of key aspects
        * Type of work, skills needed, supervision, pay, growth, culture etc.
        * Very detailed but time consuming.
* There are two worlds
    * Empirical i.e the visible world.
    * Conceptual i.e virtual world.
    * We can see empirical world and make inferences about conceptual world but it can't be reversed.

## Introduction
* Negative feeling when you assess aspects of your job.
* Behaviours individuals may engage because of job dissatisfaction.

    * EXIT - Leaving the job.
    * VOICE - Reporting/feedback given by the employee.
    * LOYALTY - Kattappa from Bahubali.
    * NEGLECT - Not doing any work, disobey and are not taking any active steps.
        * Worse then EXIT because here we dont know for sure about an individual whereas in EXIT, we definitely know that the individual is going and we need to hire another one.

## Counterproductive Work Behaviour (CWB)
* Engaging in some other work that is not productive to the organization in the time allocated for the productive work for the organization.
* This happens mainly because the employee feels a sense of injustice.
> What can be done in these cases?
* Try to find reasons for dissatisfaction by conductiong a survey or asking for feedback.
* Measure CWB and identify areas of workplace improvement.
* Creating teams, formal policies and incentivizing teams can help reduce CWB.

## Absenteeism
* Consistent negative relationship with job satisfaction.
* Higher job options results in high absenteeism because they are constantly giving interviews and would want to leave their current job.

## Turnover
* Intention to leave the organization.
* Positive relationship between leaving and dissatisfaction.
* This is stronger than absenteeism because in absenteeism it is possible than individual is not looking for a job but is not being present for the organization but here, the individual has already decided to leave the organization.
* It is high in places with higher job options.
* **Push and pull effect**
    * Something happens that makes the sense of injustice even more stronger and you are pushed to leave the organization is called push effect.
    * Pull effect means individual is not seeking other job currently even though he or she is dissatisfied with the job.
    * But then competitors approach them and ask to leave their job is called pull effect.
