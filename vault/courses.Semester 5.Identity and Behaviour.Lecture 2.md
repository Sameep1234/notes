## Schools of Psychology (Cont.)

## Functionalism

- Mind and behaviour are adaptive.
- This means that mind and behaviour are not static. They go hand in hand.
- Functionalist study mental feats like learning, memory and problem solving.
- Issue
  - No scientific method to determine the role of mind (Consciousness of mind).
  - Can't be called scientific because it can't be generalised. It varies from individual to individual.
  - Furthermore, it is not observed and experiemented and hence it is other reason for it not being scientific.

## Behaviourlism

- Not focus on mind, see only the behaviour i.e the observable actions.
- We can't see what's on the mind, behaviour is the only thing that can be observed.
- Eg. Dog video with bell and food. Dog associates whenever bell is rung, food will come and hence dog starts salivating on seeing bell even when there was no food around.
- Three characteristics to keep in mind
  - Complex behaviour comes from elementary behaviour that we have learnt from the birth.
  - Focus only on learned behaviour. Disregard any behaviour that the child may have born with.
  - Human's behaviour is no different that that of an animal.

## Gestalt Psychology

- Structuralists are wrong.
- The mind is not made of elements, but it is one as a whole.
- It works as a whole by identifying certain relationships and patterns.
  - Objects perceived inthe simplest form.
  - Humans naturally follow lines or curves.
  - Mind will attempt to fill in the detail that it not there.
    - Eg. Below images

- Principles
  - Emergence - Look for some patterns
  - Multistability - Two or more figures in the same image.
  - Reification - Eg. Above cube which is not there but we are able to see it.
  - Invariance - Images that appear symmetrical but is not proven. We **assume** that they are symmetrical.
  - Closure
  - Similarity
  - Proxitmity
  - Continuity

## Johari Window

> Principle - If you are aware about yourself and this information is public/made available to the general public, they your chances of success and happiness increases.

- It is based on the fact of awareness of inner being and openness to share information with others.
- Two elements of Johari window
  - Individual and others
  - Known and unknown information
- This makes four quadrant.
  - First - Information that I as well as others are aware about. It is also called as **arena.**
  - Second - Information that I am not aware but others are. It is also called **blind spot.**
  - Third - Information that I am aware but other are not. It is also called as **facade**
  - Fourth - Information that I as well as others are not aware about. It is also called **unknown/dark.**
- Objective of Johari Window
  - Increase the area in **arena** which means the open area/free self
- We can disclose the information that we know and others don't to increase arena.
- As for the information that others know but we don't, we take the feedback and increase arena.
- These include behaviour, attitude, feelings, knowledge, experience and skills at an individual level.
- For the organization, arena is very small and to increase this area, we need to open up to the team assigned. We should also be ready to seek feedback. Furthermore other members should not feel that they are being judged.
- To reduce the fourth quadrant, we need to have as many diverse experiences as possible at individual level. At manager level, we can conduct various kinds of interesting activiteis where other members open up. We must provide new opportunities for others to gain diverse experiences.
