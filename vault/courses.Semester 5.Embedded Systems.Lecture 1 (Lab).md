## Selection and Coding

> #### This was the lab session but theory was taught.

## Criteria's to select microcontroller

- Computational need - Efficiency, cost etc.
  - 8-bit vs 16-bit vs 32-bit
  - Speed
  - Power Consumption
  - Packaging
    - Space
    - Assembling
    - Prototyping end product
  - Amount of RAM and ROM on chip
  - No. of I/O pins
  - No. of timers
  - Upgradability to new versions
  - Cost per unit
- Availability of software development tools
  - Availability of
    - Assemblers
    - Debugger
    - Code-efficient C-language compiler
    - Technical Support
    - In-house and outside expertise
- Reliable source of microcontroller
  - Number of companies supplying controller.
  - Are they reliable?
  - Will it support in future?

> We would be using AVR Microcontrollers

## Harvard vs Princeton

- Harvard

## RISC vs CISC

- CISC
  - Complex Instruction Set Computer
  - Single instruction can execute several low-level operations (including load from memory, artihmetic operations and memory store).
  - Capability of multi-step operations.
- RISC
  - Reduced Instruction Set Computer
  - Low complexity
    - Speed-up
    - Less errors in implementation
  - Less transistors
  - More space and registers
- Conclusion

## AVR Microcontrollers

- Follows Harvard Architecture
- Follows RISC architecture with CISC instruction set
- Full-form - Advanced Virtual RISC
- 8 Bit Bus (For our application)
- Pin count between 8 to 100
- Scalable
- 32 working registers
  - All connected to ALU
- Single Cycle Execution
  - One instruction per external clock
  - Low power consumption
- Efficient core
- High system level integration

## Extra points

- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-04-18-37-03.png)
- For ATMEGA, we have 4 ports each of 8 bit.
- Each pin is configurable
- Types of configuration
  - Input with internal pull-up
  - Input with no pull-up
  - Output (Driven Low)
  - Output (Driven High)
- Each Port will have **3 main registers**
  - DDRx - Data Direction Register
    - For configuring data direction (whether input or output)
  - PORTx - Port output/Driver Register
    - Output Mode
  - PINx - Port Input Register
    - Reading Mode

> **How to give direction?**

- For any Pin, if it is defined 0, then it represents input pin and vice versa.
