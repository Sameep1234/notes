## Piaget's and Theory

## Piaget's Theory

- It's main principle is that children act on their physical environment by playing and exploring to develop schemes.
- Schemes are nothing but metal representation of bodily movement of something that a person can do with an object.
- Example of scheme include cricket bat and watch.
- Schemes develop through **assimilation and accomodation.**
- Assimination is the process by which new expeciences are incorporated into existing schemes.
- Accomodation is the process by which schemes are changed and new experiences are **assimilated.**
- Example is of a child trying to stack smaller blocks on hollow bigger block.
- Another example can be of telephone. After multiple iterations a child knows that when a telephone rings, we pick it up and talk. Similar is the case with wireless mobile phones but the range is low in wired case.
- Thus, identifying the scheme is of prime importance. So, for the telephone example, the scheme is that whenever it rings, someone comes and picks it up.
- Now, the new experience is of mobile phones. What to do when it rings? This has to be incorported by the child.
- Operations
  - Those actions that can be reversed or they are called reversible actions.
  - Types of operations
    - Cause and effect - Eg. Switch
    - Conservation of substance - Eg. Clay
- Four stages
  - **Sensorimotor stage** (birth to 2 yrs) 
    - Focus on present object and not on the object that is not there.
    - They have basic schmes of shaking, twisting, pushing etc. (inbuilt)
  - **Preoperational stage** (2 to 7 years)
    - Think about the objects that are not present.
    - Don't think of reversible consequence of actions.
    - Use perception rather than logic.
    - Eg. Water in different shapes of container.
  - **Concrete-Operational stage** (7 to 11 yrs)
    - These are tied to their actual experiences.
    - Eg. Water in bottle to glass
    - **They are not able to generalise the results to all the types of substances.**
    - They are not able to think in hypothetical situations.
  - **Formal-Operational stage** (11 to 16 yrs)
    - Notice similarites between operations performed on different objects.
    - **They are able to generalise the results obtained in one situations to other situations.**
    - They can now think in hypothetical world.
    - Eg. How much air does a room contain? It is the volume of the room.

## Vigotsky's Theory

- Its main principle is that children develop in the social world by interacting with other people and products of their cultural history.
- Eg. Child born in a tribe and in a modern family.
  - The difference between learning language in modern family and that in tribe would be of written documentation.
  - Tribe people might not have a written manuscript of the symbols and language that they use whereas modern family have perfectly well maintained documentation of the rules and regulations of their language.
  - Thus, a child in tribe might learn about only the spoken part and not the written part whearas in modern family, a child learns both.
- Social elements
  - Symbols
  - Knowledge
  - Ideas
  - Mode of reasoning

## Difference in perspective of both theories

- In the above example, from piaget's perspective, the child discovered the rule of commutativity because the child acted on the pebbles (physical environment) and while playing with it.
- From the vigotsky's perspective, the child belongs to the community where they know how to count or at least that community value counting because of which the child started counting.
- Otherwise, the child could have done numerous other activities with the pebbles like throwing it, catching it etc.
- This also means that the community also has some symbols that facilitate counting. Otherwise, how will a child count?
