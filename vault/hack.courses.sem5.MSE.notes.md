## Diffusion

- Mass transport of atomic ovement under influence of thermal energy and concentration gradient.
- Atoms move from higer to lower conc.
- Inter-diffusion : diff elements
- Self-diffusion: same element
- "**Vacancy diffusion**" - 
  - we need **activation energy** to go from one site to another. That is for diffusion. 
  - To find probability of atoms haing energy > E\*

  - For self diffusion - need 2 activation energy
    1. Vacancy creation  
    2. to move an atom
  - Flux in opp dir
- "**Interstetial Diffusion**" -
  - It is faster to add smaller impuritiesin interstetial place.

## Diffusion in ionic solids

- Schottkey - Cation vacancy carries diffu. flux
- Frankel - cation interstetial carries flux

## Ficks law

- **1st Law -** **TIME INDEPENDENT**
- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-05-08-12-44.png)
- D is diffusion coeff
- \-ve due to movement from higher to lower concentration
- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-05-08-25-47.png)
- **2nd Law -** **TIME DEPENDENT**
- The concentration of diffusing solute varies according to time and depth.

- Cx = 0.80
- Cs = 1.20
- Co = 0.25
- D = 1.6 \* 10^(-11)
- x = 0.5mm = 0.5\*10^(-3)
  find value of erf(z) , then:

- cx = 0.45%
- x = 2\*10-3
- co = 0.20%
- cs = 1.30%

- d0 is temp independent, d is temp dependent
- take time T in seonds!
- and x in meter

## Binary phase diagram

- If system consists of 2 ocmponents then the equilibrium of phases exist. 
- This is shown by binary phase diagram
- these both can be metal-metal or metl-compound or cmpnd-cmpnd
- **Isomorphous system**
