## Diffusion
* Mass transport of atomic ovement under influence of thermal energy and concentration gradient.
* Atoms move from higer to lower conc.
* Inter-diffusion : diff elements
* Self-diffusion: same element
* "**Vacancy diffusion**" - 
    * we need **activation energy** to go from one site to another. That is for diffusion. 
    * To find probability of atoms haing energy > E*
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-10-05-08-31-46.png)
    * For self diffusion - need 2 activation energy
        1. Vacancy creation  
        2. to move an atom
    * Flux in opp dir
* "**Interstetial Diffusion**" -
    * It is faster to add smaller impuritiesin interstetial place.
## Diffusion in ionic solids
* Schottkey - Cation vacancy carries diffu. flux
* Frankel - cation interstetial carries flux

## Ficks law
* **1st Law -** **TIME INDEPENDENT**
* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-05-08-12-44.png)
* D is diffusion coeff
* -ve due to movement from higher to lower concentration

* **2nd Law -** **TIME DEPENDENT**
* The concentration of diffusing solute varies according to time and depth.

* Cx = 0.80
* Cs = 1.20
* Co = 0.25
* D = 1.6 * 10^(-11)
* x = 0.5mm = 0.5*10^(-3)

# Binary phase diagram
* If system consists of 2 ocmponents then the equilibrium of phases exist. 
* This is shown by binary phase diagram
* these both can be metal-metal or metl-compound or cmpnd-cmpnd
* **Isomorphous system**
