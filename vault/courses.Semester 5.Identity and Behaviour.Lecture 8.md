# Judgement and Attribution Theory
> Recap: Behaviour is defined as observable actions.

> The key question that we are are trying to answer is that whether any behaviour shown by the individual could be **attributed** to internal or external factors.

* To answer the question, we need to ask the following three high priority questions so as to make any valid judgement.
    * How does this person behave in **different situations**?
    * How do **others** behaving in **similar situations**?
    * How this person behaved **over time** in a **similar situations**?

> Inferences based on the above three questions
* **Distinctiveness** - Assess the **individual** for different **situations** and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the external attribution and vice versa.
* **Consensurs** - **Compare** with **others** and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the external attribution and vice versa.
* **Consistency** - Same individual **always behaved** over time and if the answer turns out to be Yes (High), it is the internal attribution and vice versa.
* Easy way to remember this is **DISCCO CAB**.

## Judgement and Shortcuts
* Necessary conditions for making judgement.
    * Information about all the three elements.
    * But many times we dont have that and at that time, you should have motivation and time for finding them.
    * So we essentially assume and shortcuts and sometimes leads to error.

## Errors and Biases in Perception
* Fundamental Attribution Error
    * This happens when we are judging **others** and **not ourselves.**
    * Here, we tend to **underestimate** the **influence of external factors** and **overestimate** hte **influence of internal factors.**
* Self-Serving Biad
    * This happens when we are judging **ourselves** and **not others.**
    * This is a complete opposite of fundamental attribution error.
    * Whenever we are successful, we tend to attribute it to **internal factors** and vice versa.

## Shortcuts in Judging Others
* Selective Percepton
    * Tendency to **choose** to interpret what one sees based on one's interest, experience, attitude and background.
    * Eg. We don't read each and every news that comes on the feed, we **choose** to read only those that interests us.
* Halo Effects
    * Halo means angel which is ususally represented by a yellow circle above his head.
    * It is the tendency to draw a **positive general impression** about an individual/product based on a single characteristic.
    * Eg. People prefering apple products are not concerned with the competition and the features avaible in other phones and at what price and thus are **operating under the halo effect.**
* Horn Effects
    * Horns usually represent devil.
    * It is the tendency to draw a **negative general impression** about an individual/product based on a single characteristic.
    * Eg. Mother/daughter in law case.
* Stereotyping
    * It means that we are judging someone based on one's **perception of the group.**
    * Eg. Being from Gujarat means that you are very good in business or have a entrepreneurial nature.
