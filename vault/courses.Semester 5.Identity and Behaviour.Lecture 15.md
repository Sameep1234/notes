# Situation Strength Theory and Attitudes

## Introduction
* The way our personality translates to behaviour depends on the strength of situation.
* Situation strength is the degree to which norms, cues or standards dictate appropriate behaviour.
* If strength of situation is high, you need to behave "apropriately."

## Elements/Factors
* Clarity
    * Degree to which cues about work duties and responsibilities are available and clear.
    * Better the clarity, stronger the situations.
    * Eg. Nurse
* Consistency
    * Degree to which cues regarding work duties and responsibilities are compatible with each otehr.
    * Higher the consistency , stronger situations.
    * Eg. Nurse vs manager (first is compatible and second is variable).
* Constraints
    * Extent to which individual's freedom to decide or act is limited by forces outside their controls.
    * Eg. Bank Teller vs professor.
* Consequences
    * Degree to which decisions or actions have important implications fro organization or its memebers, clients etc.
    * Important consequences imply strong situations.
    * Eg. Surgeon vs primary school teacher.
