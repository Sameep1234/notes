## Scheduling Algorithm (Cont.)

## Fair-share scheduling

- The algorithms discussed till now does not include who is the user that created the process, which groups are being used etc.
- This algorithm takes care of such things.
- Please note that fair share does not necessarily mean equal, but it can also mean that if weight assigned to a process is more, the work completed by it is expected to be more in the long run.

- Some calculation
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-22-25-10.png)
  - CPUj(i) means time utilized by a process j till "i" interval.

  - The second point can be easily visualised with the help of formula.
- Example
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-22-37-44.png)
  - It is given in the question that the Process B and C combined are assigned 50% and Process A alone is assigned 50% weightage.

## Traditional (older) UNIX Scheduling

- Some calculations

- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-22-43-23.png)
- The purpose of the nicej is to maintain that the priority of any particular process does not go too down with increasing value of CPUj(i) and remains between the **assigned band.**
- Types of band with **decreasing order of priority**
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-22-46-13.png)
  - From the above figure, we can conclude that the swapper band has the highest priority whereas the user processes have the lowest priority.
- Example
  - Note that in the below example, we are only considering **user processes.**
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-28-22-49-26.png)
  - **Note that the process which will be executing next will be that whose priority value is lowest which means highest priority.**
