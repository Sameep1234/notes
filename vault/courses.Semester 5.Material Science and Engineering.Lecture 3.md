## Crystal Lattice

### Sorry for the inconvinience but please refer this [site](https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes/omAwLOv3wYSYrihgzYlu4.html) for lecture 3 notes.

## Extra Points

- A crystalline material is one in which the atoms are situated in a repeating or periodic array over large atomic distances.
- **Keep in mind that while calculating coordination number, it is the lattice which is considered and not the unit cell. A lattice a combination of unit cells.**
