## Physical Properties of Silk

- Most of the natural fibers are not strong but silk is.
- This is because it is a filament fibre and thus there are no joints.
- Pure silk is raw silk obtained directly fromthe silk worm.
- Spun silk is left over silk or damanged fibres.
- Silk is protien based fibre. Thus, it has a protien called serisin which is a type of gum.
- Thus, silk is degummed to protect it from pests.
- As a result, it looses weight and weight is added by adding sugar or tanins.
- It becomes weighted silk.

## Physical Properties of Rayon

- **Rayon is also called as regenerated cellulose. It is also pure cellulose.**
- It is a cheaper version of cotton.
- You take cellulose and dissolve in cupra ammonium hydroxide solution.
- Then we add sulphuric acide to regenerate the cellulose. We initially get a blue color because of copper present in cupra ammonium hydroxide.
- It is also called viscose rayon and cupra ammonium rayon.
- **Cotton is still stronger than rayon even though rayon is filament fibre.**
- This is because in rayon most part is amorphous whereas in cotton, most part is crystalline.

- Paintings come in the category of composite materials.
- It is a combination of inorganic and organic materials.

  - ![](/assets/images/2021-10-17-07-48-55.png)
- Paint is composed of three materials
  - Pigments - Powder form obtained from earth colors, minerals, vegetables etc.
  - Binder - Add some glue
  - Solvent (Generally water) - This we call as vehicle as it adds **flow** to the paint.
