## Learning and related theories

## Learning

> Any **relative permanent** change in **behaviour** that occurs as a result of **experience**.

- Relatively Permanent - This does not mean that the time frame should be large. It could be short but it has to be relatively larger than the past conversation.
- Change in behaviour - Obvious reasons. Observable actions. There could be many types of behaviour including learned and reflexive behaviour.
- Experience - When you pay attention or focus on a particular conversation or an event, then that convsersation or event becomes the part of **your experience.**
  - This means that we are involving sensory organs and hence it becomes a part of an experience.

## Theories

- Classical Conditioning

  > It is a **learning process** through which we **create new reflexes.**

  - Unconditioned Stimulus - Something that is already there in the environment.
  - Unconditioned Response - Reflexive behaviour.
  - Conditioned Stimulus - Something which is not part of the environment or an event that occurs multiple times.
  - Conditioned Response - Learned behaviour.
- Operant Conditioning

  > **Behaviour** is a **function of consequences**. We do something to **get something** or to **avoid something.**

  - If the consequences are positive, you repeat that activity and vice versa.
  - We call it **operant** because we operate on the world. We are not doing it automatically or reflexively. We **consciously think** about it.
