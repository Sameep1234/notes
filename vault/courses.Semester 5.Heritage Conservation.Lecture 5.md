## Patina and Metal Oxide

## Patina Continued.

- Any layer that is formed on the metal surface is called patina.
- Layers
  - Oxide
  - Carbonate
  - Sulphate
  - Acetate
  - Chloride
- Those patina which is protective in nature is called noble patina and those that are corrosive in nature are called malignant patina.
- Cuprous oxide (Brown) and cupric oxide (Black) is noble patina as they do not react and protect copper metal.
- Greenish layer deposited on copper is carbonate layer.
  - It is also known as malachite.
  - **Noble patina** but in very rare cases it is malignant patina.
- **Malignant Patina (Bronze Disease)**
  - Bronze metals form chloride layer (atacamite and nantokite).

## Malachite and Azurite formation

- ![](/assets/images/2021-09-10-23-50-53.png)
- Two forms of carbonate layer.
- Carbonate ions are formed when carbon dioxide is dissoved in water.
- We may also get carbonic acid in a similar fashion.
- On scratching a corroded metal, we get pure metal inside it. Now that in turn acts as anode and the corroded layer acts as cathode.
- Then follow the above figure.
- Oxidation number is the charge an element has in a compound/molecule.

> If in the environment, if you have a lot of CO2, then what will you get? (Azurite or Malachite)
>
> - We will get azurite as in more CO2 concentrated areas, it is a stable carbonate layer.

## Iron Oxide

- Nature of Fe2O3 is unstable (doubtfull) and porous
- This is malignant patina.
- Because of its porosity, the inner core of the metal is always exposed and hence is called malignant patina.
- **Startling fact**
  - Qutub Minar is made of iron.
  - Built about 1500-1600 years back.
  - But still, there is no rusting.
  - **In iron, a little bit of phosphorous is mixed and it forms a complex layer by reacting with hydrogen and oxygen.**
  - Hence, the iron pillar does not get corroded.
  - Now, phosphorous and sulphur have tendency to crack any metal (even iron) if it remains inside that metal.
  - Hence, when iron is heated to 1500 degrees, phosphorous and sulphur escape and iron is protected.
  - Then, with continuous hammering, the remaining phosphorous comes out on the surface of the metal and hence forms a protective layer.
  - To make the pillar, a little bit of zinc was also added in the bottom/base of the pillar.
  - Zinc acts as a **sacrificial anode.**
  - This means that zinc will corrode and protect iron.
