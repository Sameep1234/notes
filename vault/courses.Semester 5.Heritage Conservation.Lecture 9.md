## Wood (Cont.) and Intro to Paper

## Thermal Degradation

- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-18-04-37.png)
- It is the lignin that catches fire quickly and burns. The actual wood is quite heat resistant.

## Biological Desgradation

## Defects in polychrome wood

- Varnish is a kind of protective coating.
- At first, the varnish is very shiny and transperent but over time it turns yellowish brown.

## Prevention and Conservation

- Beat the **wood pulp** so many times that is becomes paper.
- Firstly a very fine powder is formed.
- Mechanical Process - Discussed above
- Chemical Process
  - Sulphite Process
    - Take H2SO4 + CaCO3 (Limestome)
    - Calcium Bisulphite is formed
    - Dissolves the wood chip
    - It dissolves most wood but not all.
  - Kraft Process
    - Sodium Hydroxide + Sodium Sulphide + water.
    - Almost all of the wood is dissolved.
  - Now you have added strong alkali or strong acid and disturbed the pH.
  - Thus, you have added some amount of degrading process.
  - It thus becomes the intrinsic agent responsible for degradation of paper.
  - This processes breaks down the lignin and shorter chain hemicellulose.

## Bleaching

- ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-18-30-29.png)
- The wood pulp becomes white due to bleaching.
- **Even though it breaks lignin and hemicellulose, it does not harm the cellulose chain.**

## Extra Points

- Rag paper is made of 100% pure cellulose and is the best paper.
- This can be obtained only from chemical process as the wood pulp can be dissolved almost completely releasing the pure cellulose.
- They also dissolve hemicellulose and lignin.
