 ## Ways by which we can preserve the artefact
1. Preventive conservation - 
* When the condition of object is good by NOT touching the object and ensure the protection
* Working on the surroundings
* Controlling temperature, environment, relative humidity, lighting, pollutants and pests

2. Curative/ Interventive Conservation - 
* Some damage is already happend to the object and then working on it directlyto preserve 

## Relative Humidity
* Relative humidity   Higher temp - more moisture can be contained in the env.

> _Absolute humidity doesnot tell how comfortable is the envrinment, whereas relative humidity does._
* Dew Point - Air is saturated with water at dew point
* Temp below dew point - rain
* If dew point if more - holding lot of water vapour vice versa

> Dew point and RH help us knw the actual climate status
* Fluctuations in Temp, RH is bad for objects
## How to maintain the RH?
* Coarse silica jel - 1/2 kg
* Highly absorbent silica gel - 50g
* What is gel? A colloid - liqid trapped in solid scaffolding
* Silica gel: has lotss of pores and it will ADSORB the water particles.
* Preconditioned silica gel cassets - It will bring the RH to 50% RH 
* "Artsorb" - RH less: release some moisture | RH more: absorb the moisture

# In museum
## Incorrect Temperature
* Too high: gradual disintigration or discoloration of organic materials
* Too low: farctures of painys, adhesives, and other polymers
* Fluctuating: causes fractures and delamination in brittle, solid materials. 
## Contaminates
* Disintigrate, discolor, corrode
* Contaminants include:
    * gages(H2S, NO2, S02, O3, O2)
    * Liquids(grease from human hands)
    * Solids(salt that corrodes metal, dust adhearing to the surface)
    * Air pollution
## Incorrect Humidity
* Damp
* Decolorisation
* crushes and fractures 
## Lighting System
* Photochemical degradation: light is a form of energy and induces some chemical reactions.
* Intensity of visible light is measured in LUX
* 1 lux = 1 lumen/m sq

1. Luminous flux -  Lumen
* Total amount of light emmited by a light source is Luminous flux
* Total amount

2. Illumination - Lux
* How much light is falling on a surface
* 1lux/m sq
* Distance dependent

3. Luminous intensity - Candela
* Light in a solid angle(3D angle - measured in steradian)  
* Brughtness of light in a perticular direction
* **Direction specific**
* Independent of distance from source to surface | only solid angle matters

## Colour temperature
* In Kelvin

*  Note- Color temp is more: Cool | Color temp is less: Warm
