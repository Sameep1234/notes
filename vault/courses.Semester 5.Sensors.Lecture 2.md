## Callibration of Sensors and Errors

## Advantages of Linear sensors

- Callibration will be easy.
- Scale would be crowded for non-linear sensor at lower temperature range.
- Calculation becomes easier.

## Extra Points

- ADC is always linear.
- Equation written in the program will be stored in the processor.
- Sometimes, the equation is complicated and hence it becomes difficult for processor to sovle that equation.
- To solve this, we use table look up. In this, we form a table of x and y values and then search for a particular value. We can use some of the most efficient search algorithm.
- Callibration means to create a table between the two variables.

## Algorithm for Digital instrument

- Start ADC by sending a pulse at the start of conversion line and then will wait for end of conversion line.
- Then read y1 (always an integer discrete value because it is output is binary).
- Calculate inverse function of x or look up in the table.
- Display because we want the value to be stable for some point.
- Add delay.
- Repeat the above procedure.

## Error and Accuracy

> Difference between measured and true value.

- Formula

> Accuracy means values that are aligned with standard rules or laws.

- Exact true value to be found is not possible. Thus, we require the best standards and these are called as primary standards.
- These do no change with temperature, pressure etc.
- Secondary standards are less accurate and are calibrated using primary standards.
- These can also be costly and thus we use working standards.
- Types of errors
  ```
  * Systematic error
      * Instrument inaccuracies
      * Faulty design of an experiment
  * Random errors
      * Human errors
      * Noise
  ```

- Measure the values generated by intrument under the test and compare it with the values generated by secondary and working stadndards.
