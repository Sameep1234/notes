# Biological Deterioration, Effect of pollutants

## Foxing stains on Paper
* Brown stains that is seen on paper, old books etc.
* Factos --> Moisture, iron (some amounts are already present in paper) and fungi.
* Iron rust is brown and red and hence foxing stain is a mixture of fungal stain and iron rust.

> Why in industrial cities we do not see lichen growth?
* This is due to air pollution.
* Lichens is killed by sulphur dioxide.
* In villages, there is less amounts of sulphur dioxide and as a result more lichens are found.
* Thus, lichens are thus an indication of good air quality in the environment.

## Silverfish

* **Note that it does not eat cellulose, it eats starch in paper which comes from sizing, the material used is starch based material.**

* Hygroscopic materials are those materials which have a tendency of the material to absorb water.
* Paper absorbs water because cellulose is very hygroscopic as they have hydroxyl ion whic combines which hydrogen ion to form water.

## Effects of pollutants
* Case study of Taj Mahal
    * Leaching of marble (already discussed in previous lectures).
* Types of pollutants

* Nature of pollutants
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-12-04-09-58-10.png)
    * Efflorescence means salt crystallizes on the surface of water.
    * Cryptofloroscence means salt crystallises inside the stone wall.
