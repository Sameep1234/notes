    * Fundamental Attributuon err {judge others, external f << Internal fact}
    * Self serving bias {Ourselves, subjective blae on ext or int}
* Shortcut in judging/ perception
    * Selective perception {choose to interpret}
    * Halo effect

    * Stereotyping
* Rational descision making model {Explore all possibilities} (10)
* Bounded Rationality {Not all, but optmiz value} (10)
* Intution {uNconcious process out of experience} (10)
* Bias in descision making
    * **Escalation of Commitment**  
        * an increased commitment to a
previous decision despite negative information.
    * **Availability Bias**
        * the tendency for people to base their judgments on information that is readily available to
them
    * **Overconfidence bias**- tendency to overestimate your own
abilities
        * Individuals whose intellectual and interpersonal abilities are weakest
are most likely to have this Bias 
        *  Research indicated that there is negative correlation between
entrepreneurs confidence and success rate
    * **Randomness error**
        * tendency of individuals to believe that they
can predict the outcome of random events e.g. wearing ___
shirt/top to an exam/interview is lucky.
    * **Hindsight bias**: 
        * tendency to
believe falsely, after an
outcome of an event is
actually known, that one
would have accurately
predicted that outcome. E.g.
AU Convocation in 2019.
    * **Confirmation bias:** 
        * tendency to seek out information that
reaffirms past choices and to discount information that
contradicts past judgments. E.g. for/against debate.
* Values 
    * basic convictions about what is right, good, or desirable
    * Terminal vs. Instrumental Values
    * Terminal values: desirable end-states of existence.
    * Instrumental values: preferred modes of behavior or means of
    achieving terminal values. 
    * Values are convictions that a specific mode of conduct or end state
    of existence is personally or socially preferable over an opposing
    mode of conduct or end state of existence.
* Person-Organization Fit
    * People who are extrovert and outspoken fit well with aggressive and teamoriented cultures.
    * People high on agreeableness match up better with a supportive
    organizational climate than one focused on aggressiveness.
    * People high on openness to experience fit better in organizations that emphasize innovation rather than standardization.

 
## Psycology
* The science of behaviour and mind 
* Application of science to solve human problems
* Feelings - unobservable | Behaviour - observable actions
* Science is gaining knowledge by observation and experimentation
## Structuralism
* Break down into its constituent elements (sensation/emotions/feelings)
* Method: Introspection
* What questions: "What were you feeling"
* **Problems**  
    * Got all elements but cannot comphrehend well about the function.
## Functionalist
* mind and behaviour is adaptive(perp for exam/ playing..)
* How learning/ memory happens
* Why questions
* **Problems**  
    * No scientific method to determine/ observe mind
## Behaviorism
* Observe - Experiment - Analyse
* Should study behaviour instead of mind
* 3 beliefs of behaviouralist
    * Complex behavious are orn from the pre elementry knwledge
    * Focus on learnd behviour not inbuilt 
    * humans and animals are same
* **Problems**
    * Focuses onnly on behaviour, whats inside mind is missed out 
## Gestalt psycologist 
* Mind works as whole and not in parts
* Mind triesto find patterns

## Organisational Behaviour Model
* Framework: Input, Process, Output
* EG:  
    * **Individual level:** Humans are the inputs, feelings/emotions are process, output is our work
    * **Group Level:** coordination etc
    * **Organisation level:** culture, structure

## Learning
Relatively permenant change in ones behaviour due to an experience(affecting ones sensory systems)
## Classical conditioning
* Conditioned Stimulus - condition that accompanies natural stimulus
* Unonditioned Stimulus - natural event
* Conditioned Response - behaviour for conditioned stimulus
* Unconditioned Response - how do we react naturally
## Operant Conditioning
* Behvaiour is function of consequences
## Social Learning Theory
* Individuals learn by observing others and gaining experiencing   
* **Vicarious reinforceents** - Not necessary to behave in perticular manner to know output, you can observe and and reinforce some actions
* People respond on how they percieve and define consequences NOT to the objective consequences. **_Can be different_**

## Zone of proximal development
![](/assets/images/2021-09-13-14-49-31.png)
* You will need help to bring the outermost layer to innermost layer
* What to do with the conflicts arizing from differnt perpectives.
* **Perception** is to organize and interpret sensory to give meaning to our environment
* Perception is influenced by
    * **Perceiver -**
        * Attitude
        * Motives
        * Interests
        * Experiences
        * Expectations
    * **Target**
        * Novety
        * Motion
        * Sounds
        * Background
        * Proximity
        * Similarity
        * Size
    * **Situation/ Context**
        * Time


1. Perciever:  
* Motives of the girl were different
* Attitude of the man/ hero + the one who hit the car towards the preg lady.
* Expectation in 1st part, girl thought he will support her

2. Target - Sounds-music when boy gets out of the car
* background - crowd
* similarity - the hitter and the hero was of same strength in boys version

3. Time/ situation - barren/time when no one was there 

* How to resolve conflict?
    1. motive and interest
    2. intention
# Attribution theory
* whether the behaviour can be attributed ot a person or a situation
* person - internal attributon (scared easily ,from pppy)
* environment - exernal attribution
## 3 ques to know External or Internal Attribution (DISCCO CAB)
* How does this person behave in different situation?
![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-14-59-21.png)
* How others behave in similar situation?
![](/assets/images/2021-09-17-15-00-32.png)
* How this person behaved overtime in the similar tasks?

## **Shortcuts in judging others**
* Funamental attribution error - when we judge oothers, we tend to over estimate the effects of other factors.
* Selective Perception - tendency to choose to inetrpret what one sees based on ones intrerest, background, experience and attitude.

Contrast effect - you are an interviewer, 1st,2nd,3rd candidate is pathetic, 4th slight bet ter. score to 4th is slight higher than the ideal score.
           
**I** didnt **kill** **18** **children**.

employee - get to kno wabout interests and expectations about your boss
- motive
- interests
- expecttatoions are key drivers.

## Assignment 1 - Explain 3 concepts by observing by surroundings or record videos/ enact. Combined 5 mmin total.
## Assignment 2 - take a webseris or videos, explain any 3 concepts from the class discussion. and explain how they are visible


> personality: sum of ways in which an individulal reacts to and interacts with others personality and infuence the behavior

## How to measure personality??
tests to assess some1s personality
1. personality tetst: self report | observer ratingi
weakness of self report: biases, we want to be desirable how society percieves to be good.
observer rating: ONly when we have suff exp; interac might not be suff enough, biases, can take longer time 

## What influences our personality:
1. situation and fctors
2. people we are closer to
3. ENVIRONMENT - 60%
4. HERIDITY - gender reflexes 40%
5. personality traits: stable char. of an individual

## Myers-Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) - FOR JUDGING PERSONALITY by letters
1. extrovet vs introvert (E|I)
2. sensing vs intutive(S|N)
- practical, focus on ddetails | uncinciuous opinions
3. thinking vs feeling(T|F)
4. judging vs perceptive(J|P)
- need structure | flexi and spontanous

it forces indivudual to fit into one of the dimensions

## Big 5 personality model
1. conscientiousness (Dhoni)
responsible dependeble, persistent and organized
are inclined towards OCB: going abv and beyond yr call of duty
2. Emotional stability| opposite: nuroticism
- calm, self confid, can work in changing env
3. extraversion
- sociable, gregarious,assertive( true to  your stand firmly)
4. Openness to experience
- to be intellectually curious, creative and imaginative.

# Situation strength theory
## Factors taht determing strength of situation
1. Clarity: duties and responsibility
* if I am clear in how to behave => Strong situation
* Eg: Nurse, we in 5 star hotel
2. Consistency: Degree to which cues regarding work duties and responsibilities are compatible
* High consistency =>  strong scenario
* nurse vs manager
3. Constraints: extent to which freedom to decide acc to his or her own wishes
* org: bank teller(fix work to do) vs professor(varied acc to faculties- less constraints)
4. Consequences
* breaking a law can have huge consequences

> manager - balance the need of situation strength

## Trait Activation Theory
* Some situations or events activate a trait more than others
* an sales person job,extraversion will be the quality
## Attitudes and Comonents
* Evaluative statements or judgements about people/object
* Attitude is evaluative statements or judgements about variuos things
* Attitude ALWAYS have feelings associated with it
