# Social Learning Theory

## Social Learning Theory
> Individuals learn by **observing** what happens to other people and just by being told about something as well as through direct experience.

* In layman terms, social learning theory is that we learn by observing others and in turn gaining **experience**.
* Observational learning is the process of watching others for gaining **experience.**
* Vicarious Reinforcement - Not necessary for an individual to explicitly behave in order to learn, it is enough to observe others for some actions and their consequences.
* It is a natural extension of operant conditioning.
* **It depends on how an individual perceives and defines the consequence.** Eg. Severity of phone confiscation may be different for those who use two phones and those who use only one.
* **Bobo Doll Experiment is the very good example of social learning.**
* Processes
    * Attentional Processes - focusing on critical features.
    * Retention Processes - How well the individual remembers action of model.
    * Motor reproduction processes - Converting retained thoughts into action.
    * Reinforcement processes - Motivation to exhibit modeled behaviour.

## How do children learn?
* They act on their physical environment.
* They are like little scientists who experiment on physical environment.
* Scheme is **what an object does.**
