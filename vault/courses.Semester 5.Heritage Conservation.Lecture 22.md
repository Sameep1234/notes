## Pest Control Management

1. avoid 
2. block
3. destroy

Since we don't want the chemical treatments, we change the temperature. 
Carbon dioxide tent: More CO2 less O2. Hence, pests cannot survive. 
Nitrogen Treatement: By nitrogen chamber. 

## Scientific dating:
1. Chronological dating: Relative dating
2. Stylistic dating: Relative dating
Not only helps in establishing the dates but also to authenticating the artefacts.

### Statigraphy: 
In archeological excavations the trench is dug inch by inch.
Anything recovered on the top, is new as compared to the ones found deeper. 

### Lead isotopre Dating:

Employeed for: rocks, paintings, ceramics etc. Since, there is a little bit of lead present in them, the dating can be known. In paintingslead pigments are sometimes used. Lead Oxciddes can have harmful effects.
Eg: If lead 210 is found in any of the paintings, metal or sculpture, it can be inferred that it is not more than 32 years old. This is because the half life of lead210 is only 22 years. 

Radioactive meterials have the tendency to disintegrate. Rocks contain Uranium isotopes and since they are radioactive, the start disintigrating.
End product: Uranium238 -->lead 206
                    235 -->lead 207
                    232 -->lead 208

### Radiocarbon dating: 
Helps in establishing date of organic materials. C12, C13, C14 are isotopes of carbon. C14 is in trace amounts.

Can be determined by the raio od C14 and C12 

### Thermoluminescence Dating: 
For fired ceramics. Every minerals storesome photons. During firing process, the stored photons are released/escaped and so the clock is reset to zero. After firing, the object will again start absorbing the photons.
