# Wood

## Chemical Properties

## Physical Properties
* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-16-25-06.png)
* Wood is a porous material and **specific gravity** is the density of the wood excluding these pores.
* Wood shrinks because of the pores. The moisture gets trapped in the pores and when it heats up, the moisture escapes and the wood shrinks.
* It it shrinks by reducing the length, it is called **cracking** whereas if it rotates as a result of shrinking, it is called **warping**.

## Directions of wood
* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-16-29-58.png)
* There is a steady flow of water as long as trunk is connected to the roots.
* The moment it is cut, the water will escape slowly.
* As a result, the wood will begin to shrink.
* Thus, we require to cut the wood in a very specific manner/direction such that there is minimum amount of shrinking.
* Wood has **anisotropic/directional** property which means it has different properties in different directions.
* This means that percentage of shrinkage will be different in different directions.
* If the wood is cut along the longitudinal direction, there will be minimum shrinking.
* But, cutting accross longitudinal directions will not result in long planks of wood.
* Thus, we cut the wood in radial direction only as it has lower shrinkage percentage then longitudinal and will result in longer planks.
* The water content, if the wood cut in the tangential direction, is more and thus there would be more shrinking whereas it is not the case in longitudinal and radial direction.
* Calculating the age of wood with the help of rings is called **dendrochronology**.
* The seasonal adaption in the radial direction is the reason of lower warping and thus it won't change anymore.

## Deterioration
* ![](/assets/images/2021-10-16-16-52-12.png)
* Physical Degradation
    * Warping
    * Cracking
    * Splitting
* If the wood loses lignin (binding agent), the wood will develop crack because it will try to fall apart.
* The outer particles in wood will pull the inner wood in opposite direction resulting in a large straight crack.
* Swelling and shrinking can also result into network of cracks instead of straight crack.
* Chemical Degradation

    * **Pulp** is the precipitate that you obtain when you dissolve wood in either strong acid or strong alkali.

## Extra Points
* % shirinkage in
    * Longitudinal Direction - 0.1% - 0.2%
    * Radial Direction - 1% - 2%
    * Tangential Direction - 6% - 12%
* **Polychrome wood** means that wood is colored (in fact it is multicolored).
* The sculptures made of wood are generally not carved from single wood.
* They are joined seperately. To cover the joints, we use the following process.
    * Wood + Iron nail (to join different parts of wood)
    * a layer of cloth (muslin or markin in most cases) to hide the joints
    * Add acid free tissue paper (i.e handmade paper)
    * Add clay (chalk + kaolin) + glue (it decreases the porosity of papers by filling the pores)
* **Gilded wood** is prepared in similar manner and is polished a lot.
* Then it is painted to give shiny appearance.
