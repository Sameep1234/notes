## Extra Points

- Engineering applications always require accurate measurement and control over physical quanities.
- It is easy to transmit signal in electrical form.
- We might need to process the signal and it is easier to perform operations in electrical form.
- Thus, we need sensors.

## Transducers and Sensors

- Convert one form of signal to another form.
- If you convert non-electrical signal to an electrical signal, it is called a sensor.
- Thus, sensors are subset of transducers.
- Actuator is device converting electrical to non-electrical signal.

> We need curve fitting to obtain equation from the data points.

## Curve Fitting

- Process of finding suitable equation between y and x when table of values of x and y is known.
- Polynomial form in general case
- Steps in excel
  - Select the data points.
  - Go to insert.
  - Select scatter plot.
  - Chart will appear.
  - Right click on any data point on the chart and select trendline option.
  - Choose Polynomial and select the appropriate order.
  - **Check the display equation and display R^2 in chart option.**
