## Extra Points
* Engineering applications always require accurate measurement and control over physical quanities.
* It is easy to transmit signal in electrical form.
* We might need to process the signal and it is easier to perform operations in electrical form.
* Thus, we need sensors.

## Transducers and Sensors
* Convert one form of signal to another form.
* If you convert non-electrical signal to an electrical signal, it is called a sensor.
* Thus, sensors are subset of transducers.
* Actuator is device converting electrical to non-electrical signal.

> We need curve fitting to obtain equation from the data points.

## Curve Fitting
* Process of finding suitable equation between y and x when table of values of x and y is known.
* Polynomial form in general case
* Steps in excel
    * Select the data points.
    * Go to insert.
    * Select scatter plot.
    * Chart will appear.
    * Right click on any data point on the chart and select trendline option.
    * Choose Polynomial and select the appropriate order.
    * **Check the display equation and display R^2 in chart option.**
