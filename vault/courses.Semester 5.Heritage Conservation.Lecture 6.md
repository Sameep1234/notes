# Steel and Ceramics

## Stainless Steel

* Chromium oxide layer is impervious layer. This means that chromium layer is non-porous.
* If there is a small scratch in steel objects, then the chromium oxide layer is ripped off and the inner (iron) metal is exposed.
* This is the place where you may see corrosion in steel objects.
* Bidriware

    * Made using zinc, copper and silver.
    * Zinc and silver provide silvery appearance and copper provides a bit of yellow appearance.
    * This black layer appears because of alloy of zinc and copper. Silver is very low in quantity.
    * First zinc and copper is melted and then the object is dipped in copper sulphate solution to obtain a blackish color.
    * This black is temporary.
    * Now, with metallic stylus, designs are engraved. It is a very sharp metallic point/tool.
    * Then, they take silver wire and hammer it in those grooves and thus this silver design is made. This is called silver inlay.
    * Now, to smoothen the surface, it is polished. With regorous polishing, all the temporary black goes away and the entire silvery surface turns white.
    * In final preparation, **mud of bidar** + water + dilute ammonium chloride and a dough is made and then you rub this object.
    * By doing this, all the zinc area becomes permanent black.
    * Silver does not become black because silver is less reactive then zinc and hence does not get converted to black color.
    * **Silver only reacts with sulphide. This is chloride.**

## Ceramics
> Made of clay. It is neither metallic nor organic. Clay is the final product of weathering of rock.

* Clay is basically silica and alumina. (SiO2 and Al2O3).
* When you introduce water, clay becomes really soft and it disintegrates easily.
* To overcome this problem, we heat the clay at very high temperature and as a result, it becomes very hard and dense.
* So basically, on heating we are removing water and hence it looses its plasticity.
* Terracotta army
    * ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-02-41.png)
    * Terra means earth
    * Terracota is basically fired clay.
    * Brick is made of terracota.
* BASIC Materials
* Stucco is made from unbaked clay or sunbaked clay. It is not fired but is sunbaked and hence becomes crucial to study.
* It is majorly found in Gandhara, Afghanistan.

## Types of clay
* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-15-46.png)
* Terracota comes under erathenware. It gets red color due to inclusion of iron.
* Bone china is a type of porcelain and fired at 1350 degrees and is mostly white in color.
* White colored clay called kaolin is used to make bone china.

## Stages of clay
* ![](/assets/images/2021-09-11-11-18-04.png)
* Bisuqe is also called as bicuit firing and is the first firing stage.

## Extra Points
* When you keep on heating/firing any material, the ultimate color it will emit will always be white.
* This happens because of the stages of heating. In the first stage, the carbon layer is burnt and is black in color.
* Now on further increasing the temperature, you will see orange color and then becomes red and then it becomes ash colored (grey) and finally becomes white.
