## Steel and Ceramics

## Stainless Steel

- Chromium oxide layer is impervious layer. This means that chromium layer is non-porous.
- If there is a small scratch in steel objects, then the chromium oxide layer is ripped off and the inner (iron) metal is exposed.
- This is the place where you may see corrosion in steel objects.

  - Made using zinc, copper and silver.
  - Zinc and silver provide silvery appearance and copper provides a bit of yellow appearance.
  - This black layer appears because of alloy of zinc and copper. Silver is very low in quantity.
  - First zinc and copper is melted and then the object is dipped in copper sulphate solution to obtain a blackish color.
  - This black is temporary.
  - Now, with metallic stylus, designs are engraved. It is a very sharp metallic point/tool.
  - Then, they take silver wire and hammer it in those grooves and thus this silver design is made. This is called silver inlay.
  - Now, to smoothen the surface, it is polished. With regorous polishing, all the temporary black goes away and the entire silvery surface turns white.
  - In final preparation, **mud of bidar** + water + dilute ammonium chloride and a dough is made and then you rub this object.
  - By doing this, all the zinc area becomes permanent black.
  - Silver does not become black because silver is less reactive then zinc and hence does not get converted to black color.
  - **Silver only reacts with sulphide. This is chloride.**

## Ceramics

> Made of clay. It is neither metallic nor organic. Clay is the final product of weathering of rock.

- Clay is basically silica and alumina. (SiO2 and Al2O3).
- When you introduce water, clay becomes really soft and it disintegrates easily.
- To overcome this problem, we heat the clay at very high temperature and as a result, it becomes very hard and dense.
- So basically, on heating we are removing water and hence it looses its plasticity.

  - Terra means earth
  - Terracota is basically fired clay.
  - Brick is made of terracota.
- BASIC Materials
- Stucco is made from unbaked clay or sunbaked clay. It is not fired but is sunbaked and hence becomes crucial to study.
- It is majorly found in Gandhara, Afghanistan.

## Types of clay

- Terracota comes under erathenware. It gets red color due to inclusion of iron.
- Bone china is a type of porcelain and fired at 1350 degrees and is mostly white in color.
- White colored clay called kaolin is used to make bone china.

## Stages of clay

- Bisuqe is also called as bicuit firing and is the first firing stage.

## Extra Points

- When you keep on heating/firing any material, the ultimate color it will emit will always be white.
- This happens because of the stages of heating. In the first stage, the carbon layer is burnt and is black in color.
- Now on further increasing the temperature, you will see orange color and then becomes red and then it becomes ash colored (grey) and finally becomes white.
