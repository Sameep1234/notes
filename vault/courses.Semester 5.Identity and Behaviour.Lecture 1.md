## Psychology

## Schools of Pyschology

- Structuralism
  - Break mind to its constituent elements.
  - Constituent Elements
    - Sensations
    - Images
    - Emotion/Feelings etc.
  - Method to break mind into its constituents, we use introspection.
  - Introspection means objective description. Make sure not to list its functions, meantion the **objective description.**
  - Issue
    - Does not tell the functions of mind.
    - Just breaks down into its constituent elements and then what?
