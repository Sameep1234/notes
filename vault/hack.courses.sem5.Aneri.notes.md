* **Transducers** : 1 type of signal to another
* **Signals** : Non electrical to electrical signal 
    * Sub part of transducer
    * Sensor is either voltage or current
*  Strat pulse, End of conversion(EOC) - Analog to digital convertor(ADC) will need some time to convert.
* **Primary standards** - Highly accurate instruments, unaffected by temp, etc..
* Types of errors
    1. Systematic - occures every time, 0.1 accuracy error in machine
    2. Random - Human errors, non repeated
    3. Standard error - measures how much discrepancy is likely to be in sample mean and population mean

* Know the difference between accuracy and precision

* **Span** - Linear operating range
* **Range** -  The range of measurable values
* Linearization of sensors - get best fit line since they will always have some non linearity

* Max deviation = MAX | ymi - yfi | 
* Ym is measured, Yf is fitted value
